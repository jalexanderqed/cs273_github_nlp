This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has an **Log-Stuctured-Merge-Database** (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor(WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor(SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it specially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.
