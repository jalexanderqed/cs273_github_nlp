Current implementation of histogram is accumulating all the samples from the starting of db instance. No sample is ever discarded. This is not a enough measurement for real-time monitoring, as it smooths out the busty change. 

I am proposing to introduce a computation window for histogram, that is only taking X seconds of samples (or N samples) for histogram computing. X and N will be made configurable. 

Any thoughts/comments?
