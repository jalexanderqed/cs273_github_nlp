Hello.
I use next config for java+rocksdb
1. java 8
2. rocksdb 3.1.13
3. CentOS 6.5

I start 4 data bases inside one jvm (all are in read only mode). Each data base ~ 8 Gb on disk.
After start everything looks fine. But after 1-2 hours db is going to increase CPU usage.
Check screenshot: [here](http://postimg.org/image/49uhiy71l/)
If I restart JVM everything looks fine next 1-2 hours.

HW config:
1. CPU E5-2430
2. 72Gb of RAM

All db files are in memory + I use blocks cache.
