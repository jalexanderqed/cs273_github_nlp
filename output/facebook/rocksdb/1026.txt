Changes in this patch
- Replaced histogram counter type uint64_t with std::atomic_uint_fast64_t to support update atomicity
- Extracted an interface (class Histogram) for HistogramImpl and HistogramWindowingImpl and wrapped the data in struct HistogramStat 
- Introduced HistogramWindowingImpl class for supporting real-time histogram caculation
- Extended histogram_test for better coverage

I had run performance tests to verify no regression is introduced. 

Let me know if there is anything I can do to make it easier for your review.
