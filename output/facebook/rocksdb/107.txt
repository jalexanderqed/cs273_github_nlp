Igor expressed some incredulity at the speed difference between xxhash/CityHash and the CRC32 function in RocksDB. This patch gets them a bit closer. :-)

Disassembling the Extend function shows something that looks much more healthy now. The SSE 4.2 instructions are right there in the body of the function.
