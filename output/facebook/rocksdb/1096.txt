I'm using small rocksdb base to store one meta value for another big database.

Operations log is the following:

```
Put("key", "value0");
Put("key", "value1");
Put("key", "value2");
...
Put("key", "value9999");
```

Because key is only one, I want to reduce memory consumption and set the following opening options:

```
cf_opts.write_buffer_size = 16 * 1024;
cf_opts.target_file_size_base = 64 * 1024;
cf_opts.max_bytes_for_level_base = 64* 1024;
```

Rocksdb loses the last value after some amount of writes rocksdb. 

If I set the constants above to high values (16MB), all works fine.

Is that a bug or I forgot to set some other constant?
