I have a Merge Operator which maintains a list of values. I merge values to the database like:

```
db->Merge("key1", "ADD_X")
db->Merge("key1", "DEL_X")
```

In my `MergeOperator::PartialMerge` I receive the parameters:
- `left_operand` = `ADD_X`
- `right_operand` = `DEL_X`

An add for "X" followed by a delete for "X" effectively cancels out the operations on "X". I am assuming that I should return `true` as I was able to process the operands, however I am wondering what I should set `new_value` to, should it be `nullptr` or an empty string? or something else?
