Hi guys,

We am very interested in this feature,

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/sst_file_manager.h

I see the C-API hasn't been updated to reflect it however. Basically we want to be able to limit the resources used by RocksDB. In our current thinking that comes down to:
- Limiting memory. This can be done with the read cache size for workloads with data in the Gb range and bigger.
- Limiting disk space. This is where SstFileTracker would be great.

Thanks,

Ethan.
