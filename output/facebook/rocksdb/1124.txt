Hey guys!

Working on a Visual Studio C++ project at the moment in Windows 10. I'm not very fimiliar with configuration and setting path environments, so I was wondering if I could get some help with that. 

I looked at the CMakeLists.txt file and wasn't sure about the steps. 

"Step 1: Update paths to third-party libraryes in thirdparty.inc file" Im not sure whether to go into my environment variables , nor what to type, or if I should edit the thirdparty.inc file.

Step 3: run cmake to generate project files. - Not sure what files to start on this, are there dependancies that I should have downloaded?

Any help is aprpeciated!
Hawley
