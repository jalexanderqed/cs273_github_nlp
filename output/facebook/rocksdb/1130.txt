In file db/write_thread.cc, function `WriteThread::LinkOne`

```
  Writer* writers = newest_writer_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
  while (true) {
    w->link_older = writers;
    if (newest_writer_.compare_exchange_strong(writers, w)) {
```

I think `Writer* writers = newest_writer_.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);` should in `while` block, if `newest_writer_.compare_exchange_strong` return false first, it will return false forever.
