Hi,

We are using the C-API in our current work with RocksDB. I have a question about the following limitation advertised here,

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/c.h

Does not support:
...
  . capturing post-write-snapshot

Can you guys be more explicit about what this means? What we would like to do is the following:
- Thread 1 creates snapshot and iterates over snapshot
- Thread 2 does writes after Thread 1 has created the snapshot but before Thread 1 releases the snapshot.
- Thread 3 (different from Thread 1 and Thread 2) does reads after Thread 1 has created the snapshot but before Thread 1 releases the snapshot.

The behavior we would like to have is that both Thread 2 and Thread 2 are able to read the updates created by Thread 2 after Thread 1 creates the snapshot. We are fine with (in fact we expect that) thread 1 doesn't see the updates created by Thread 2.

Is this is allowed with the current C-API, then I would like to understand what the limitation explained in the C API involves.

Thanks,

Ethan.
