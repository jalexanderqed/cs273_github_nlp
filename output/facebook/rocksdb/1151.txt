Hi, 

I am assuming that these two classes are missing in rocksdbjni.
It would be great if I can achieve atomicity of my transaction using either TransactionDB or OptimisticTransactionDB.

I request to add these two classes to rocksdbjni.
It would be great if you have any planned release day for the new rocksdbjni with these (or one of these) classes.

RocksDB rocks!!
