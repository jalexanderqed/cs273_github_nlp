`getline` on `std::cin` can be very inefficient when `ldb` is loading large values, with high CPU usage in `libc _IO_(un)getc`, this is because of the performance penalty that comes from synchronizing `stdio` and `iostream` buffers.
See the reproducers and tests in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1133 .
If an `ifstream` on `/dev/stdin` is used (when available) then using `ldb` to load large values can be much more efficient.
I thought for `ldb load`, that this approach is preferable to using `<cstdio>` or `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.
I couldn't think of a use case where `ldb load` would need to support reading unbuffered input, an alternative approach would be to add support for passing `--input_file=/dev/stdin`.
I have a CLA in place, thanks.
