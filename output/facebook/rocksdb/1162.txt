Hey All, 

Very new to RocksDB configuration and building under Visual Studio 12 2013 C++. After running in Debug mode through a VisStudio developer command line, I'm Currently running into some linker errors where I cannot find 

gflags/glfags.h 

My errors are coming out like this :

And

It seems I'm missing my Rocksdblib.lib file in my Debug folder.

Any help would be appreciated!
