Hey guys,

I seem to be running into some issues with the Visual Studio 12 2013. I don't exactly know which libraries to link, 
I am currently attempting to create a test database and close it in C++.

The linker errors I seem to be receiving seem to be a library-linker problem. However, I do not know if I should explicitly link it to 

rocksdblib.lib 
rocksdb.lib or testutillib.lib

Any help is appreciated!
Hawley
