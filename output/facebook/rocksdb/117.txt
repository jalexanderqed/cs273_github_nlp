Hi,

First of all, thank you for making this open source. I have just installed it on one of our servers (it runs CentOS 6.2) in order to evaluate it.

I installed all the dependencies and both the shared and static libraries build. However, I get two tests (out of 44) that fail.
- The first is signal_test, which in addition generates a coredump,
#0   ./signal_test() [0x406ab9] f0      /home/ehamilto/rocksdb/rocksdb-master/util/signal_test.cc:12
#1   /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x3ca681ed1d] ?? ??:0
#2   ./signal_test() [0x4069c9] _start  ??:0

(gdb) bt
#0  f0 () at util/signal_test.cc:12
#1  f1 () at util/signal_test.cc:16
#2  f2 () at util/signal_test.cc:20
#3  f3 () at util/signal_test.cc:24
#4  main () at util/signal_test.cc:31
- The second is  merge_test (does not generate a coredump),

db/merge_test.cc:344: failed: 10 == 0
#0   ./merge_test() [0x40b3e3] Options  /home/ehamilto/rocksdb/rocksdb-master/./include/rocksdb/options.h:772

I am first and foremost interested in knowing whether this is expected (I got a copy of the repository this morning) and I can ignore them but I'd also appreciate if you could say what they mean.

I built from whatever was in the repository this morning.

Thank you in advance,

Ethan.
