Hi,

I see that when it comes to logging features, the C-API provides these two functions,

`
extern ROCKSDB_LIBRARY_API void rocksdb_options_set_env(rocksdb_options_t*,
                                                        rocksdb_env_t*);
extern ROCKSDB_LIBRARY_API void rocksdb_options_set_info_log(rocksdb_options_t*,
rocksdb_logger_t*);
`

However, I don't see that it provides for the creation of objects of type rocksdb_logger_t. 

Thank you in advance,

Ethan.
