In the project in which we're hoping to integrate RocksDB, we use a number of maps cut up into rectangle objects. 

Each rectangle object consists of the following attributes
MinX, MaxX, MinY, MaxY, and Rectangle Name (each rectangle Name being a unique string).

I've used the following methods to store the rectangles into the SpatialDB
(please correct me if I'm wrong here)

for(MapSet->FirstRectangle(); MapSet->HasNextRectangle(); MapSet->Next()) 
{
features.Set("MapResolution", MapSet->Resolution)

db->Insert(WriteOptions(), BoundingBox<double>(MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY), RectName, features, {"zoom10"})
}

it took over the course of a few days to write 3500 of these objects into the rocksdb database. 

Where my problem is now, is that I want to recreate my rectangles from the Spatial Database in which I've stored these attributes. 

How do I go about retrieving these Point values from RocksDB::spatialDB
