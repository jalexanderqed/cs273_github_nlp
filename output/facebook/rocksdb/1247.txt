It is common practice to pre-allocate arrays so in high write
situations you don't need to keep
creating large array objects. As the current API requires full array,
this means an array needs to be
copied before passing to RocksDB.

By supporting the underlying C API, an additional memory copy can be
avoided leading to
a big saving in GC in high write circumstances.
