Currently c bindings only has ABI to create compaction filter with IgnoreSnapshots being false by default. And there is no way to change this value.

IgnoreSnapshots will be useful when snapshot is used very frequently and the consistent view can be ensured by the application even calling the filter on keys written before the snapshot.
