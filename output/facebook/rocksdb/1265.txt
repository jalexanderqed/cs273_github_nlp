I compiled rocksdb with O_DIRECT by modifiying in include/rocksdb/env.h
use_os_buffer = false;
use_direct_reads = true;
use_direct_writes = true;

When I run db_bench I get an "open error: Not implemented"
1. How do I fix this?
2. What is "use_os_buffer" exactly, how does it interact with use_direct_reads?
3. Can I pass these options to db_bench over the command line, somehow?
