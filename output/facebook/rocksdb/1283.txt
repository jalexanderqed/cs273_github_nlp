Looks like there's a bug in `db_ttl_impl`. `DBWithTTLImpl` overrides only the `NewIterator` method. There's no 'NewIterators' in this class, so this method is inherited, and iterators obtained as the result of this method are not `TtlIterator`. They don't know anything about TTL and won't strip the time from value.
