Good day,

We use Go and [gorocksdb](https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb).

However, as far as I'm concerned, gorocksdb requires an exposed C function [here](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/c.h) in order to run table_options.block_cache->GetUsage();

If that is the case, can we go ahead and make this modification and send a PR here first?

Thanks.

JC
