It might be useful to others to set the JAVA_INCLUDE path relative to JAVA_HOME in cases where people don't have open jdk installed or pointed to the same path as in the Makefile.

JAVA_INCLUDE = -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk/include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java-openjdk/include/linux

JAVA_INCLUDE = -I$(JAVA_HOME)/include/ -$(JAVA_HOME)/include/linux
