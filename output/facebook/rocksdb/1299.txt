Hi,

I have a application that stores small KV pair to rocksdb, the key and values are both quite small(100 - 200 bytes). Previously I'm using rocks4.2. The performance looks quite good and the memory usage is like ~4.6GB. Recently I upgraded to rocks4.8 and find the memory usage jumps to like ~12GB with the same load. Is there's any clues why the memory usage so high for 4.8? any options to reduce the memory usage there?

I'm using only two basic turnings:
- IncreaseParallelism()
- OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction()

thanks, -yuan
