Currently, setting the stats level to `kExceptTimeForMutex` will also turn off "detailed timers" (compression timing), while setting it to `kExceptDetailedTimers` will cause mutex timers to run. This is because `InstrumentedMutex` checks if stats should be reported with:
`stats->stats_level_ != kExceptTimeForMutex`

And compression stats are controlled by:
`stats->stats_level_ > kExceptDetailedTimers` (the value of kExceptTimeForMutex is less than kExceptDetailedTimers)

This pull request corrects this behavior so that `kExceptDetailedTimers` turns off both compression and mutex statistics while `kExceptTimeForMutex` leaves compression stats on. To keep compression stats off by default, the default stats level is also changed to `kExceptDetailedTimers`.
