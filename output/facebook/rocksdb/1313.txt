 If log recycling is enabled with the rocksdb (recycle_log_file_num=16)
 db->Writebatch is erroring out with keynotfound after ~5-6 hours of run
 (1M seq but can happen to any workload I guess).See my detailed bug
 report here (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1303).
 This commit is the fix for this, a check is been added not to delete
 the log file if it is already there in the recycle list.

Test Plan:
 Unit tested it and ran the similar profile. Not reproducing anymore.
