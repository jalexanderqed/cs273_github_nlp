Hi,
I found that plain table format can not support iterator->prev() and seekToLast(), but block based and cuckoo can support both of themã€‚And I use db_bench to validate them, and there is some wrong with cuckoo's prev and seekToLast as follows:

"db/db_iter.cc:605: bool rocksdb::DBIter::FindValueForCurrentKey(): Assertion `iter_->IsValuePinned()' failed."

I think  it is the problem about IsValuePinned() of different table formats. Do you have any ideas about them? Thank you!
