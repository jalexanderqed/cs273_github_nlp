Hi
In our program, we use two threads to write data to RocksDB.
- Thread A uses sync write + WAL to guarantee data consistence. 
- Thread B uses async write + disable WAL to delete some data fast. 

But to our surprise, when we use `kill -9` and restart the program, we find the newest data written by thread A is lost. E.g, thread A first writes k = v1, then k = v2, but after restart, we still get v1 for k.

We can ensure the data has been written successfully through the log, so we doubt this may be a bug here, but I can't construct a simple case to reproduce it. 

Btw, if we enable WAL in thread B, no matter how many times we use `kill -9` and restart the program, we don't lose data.
