For every multiGet call, a HashMap is ultimately created and returned to
the caller. This HashMap is never created with a capacity hint, meaning
that resizes during map buildup are likely. We know the upper bound on
the number of items that will be placed in the map (`values.length`)
which we can use to size the map appropriately on creation.
`values.length` is only an upper bound though because some entries in
`values` can be null.
