Hi,

Was starting to read C++ impl of rocksDB and not sure if this is a bug in the code. Haven't read rest of the code so can't say whether it actually is correct. Can you please confirm whether the following is correct:

// kValueTypeForSeek defines the ValueType that should be passed when
// constructing a ParsedInternalKey object for seeking to a particular
// sequence number (since we sort sequence numbers in decreasing order
// and the value type is embedded as the low 8 bits in the sequence
// number in internal keys, we need to use the highest-numbered
// ValueType, not the lowest).
static const ValueType kValueTypeForSeek = kTypeMerge;

Thus, kValueTypeForSeek should be the max type in ValueType. Max value in ValueType is kTypeColumnFamilyMerge. Should we set kValueTypeForSeek to kTypeColumnFamilyMerge?
