RocksDB 4.9 introduced a bug which caused CockroachDB state invariant assertions to fire. Bisecting the changes from v4.8 to v4.9 led to https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/c27061dae763621bdcfb5cc0d0118f57269825b8 and, in particular, this diff:

From what I understand of this code, the above change expanded the set of log files considered during recovery. It appears that RocksDB 4.11.2 has fixed the issue, notably in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2a6d0cde722a92ac6e5229c97ebbd3009921c9d9 which changed recovery to ignore stale log files.

I'm primarily looking for confirmation that https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/c27061dae763621bdcfb5cc0d0118f57269825b8  did introduce the bug fixed by https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2a6d0cde722a92ac6e5229c97ebbd3009921c9d9 so that we can feel comfortable in upgrading to v4.11.2. I haven't yet narrowed down the precise sequence of events that caused our state invariant assertions to fire, but can do so if it would be helpful.
