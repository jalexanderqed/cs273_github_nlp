I thought this is a duplicate of #928 but after debugging I think it is a  isolated problem related to Seek so I open a new Issue.

I have a database for which a tailingIterator->Seek(target) skips records. 

I think the bug is in the SeekInternal starting at lines 387:
// search_left_bound > search_right_bound
// There are only 2 cases this can happen:
// (1) target key is smaller than left most file
// (2) target key is larger than right most file

I think the comment is wrong, what seems to happen in reality is that at the higher level there is a big gap such that the file in the lower level fits completely in the gap and then 
indexer->GetNextLevelIndex returns  search_left_bound > search_right_bound I think pointing on the files after and before the gap.

I'm not 100% how to fix it but I did replace the whole thing in the else on line 386 with:
else {
  search_left_bound = 0;
  search_right_bound = FileIndexer::kLevelMaxIndex;
  continue;
} 

and that seems to work (except that the optimization with the file indexer is gone of course).
