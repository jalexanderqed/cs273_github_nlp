That is because VS 2013 does not support this C++11 feature.  See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn457344.aspx.

`Visual Studio does not support defaulted move constructors or move-assignment operators as the C++11 standard mandates. For more information, see the Defaulted and Deleted functions section of Support For C++11/14/17 Features (Modern C++).`
