hi,
I use rocksdb as my KV store. My options are:
        cache_size: 20000
        # in KB
        block_size: 16
        # in MB
        write_buffer_size: 64
        # yes|no
        compression: yes
        bloom_filter_num: 10
        max_write_buffer_number: 10
        compressiontype: zlib
        prefix_hash_len: 40
        ttl_batch_size: 1000
        ttl_sleep_sec: 3600
        wal_bytes_per_sync: 1
        bytes_per_sync: 1
        rate_limiter: 10
        sst_del_speed: 5

cache_index_and_filter_blocks = false
index_type = rocksdb::BlockBasedTableOptions::kHashSearch

I close automatic compaction due to the high write QPS. So I run compacting manually. The situation is that the VIRT is increasing when compacting and never released. How can I get out of it?

PS:If I change the compression function, will I read from old compression format database correctly?
