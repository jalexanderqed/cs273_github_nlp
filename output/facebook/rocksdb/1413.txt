In one deployment we saw high latencies (presumably from slow iterator operations) and a lot of CPU time reported by perf with this stack:

```
  rocksdb::MergingIterator::Next
  rocksdb::DBIter::FindNextUserEntryInternal
  rocksdb::DBIter::Seek
```

I think what's happening is:
1. we create a snapshot iterator,
2. we do lots of Put()s for the same key x; this creates lots of entries in memtable,
3. we seek the iterator to a key slightly smaller than x,
4. the seek walks over lots of entries in memtable for key x, skipping them because of high sequence numbers.
