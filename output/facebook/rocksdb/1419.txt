Summary: Currently our skip-list have an optimization to speedup sequential
inserts from a single stream, by remembering the last insert position.
We extend the idea to support sequential inserts from multiple streams,
and even tolerate small reordering wihtin each stream.

This PR is the interface part adding the following:
- Add `memtable_insert_prefix_extractor` to allow specifying prefix for each key.
- Add `InsertWithHint()` interface to memtable, to allow underlying
  implementation to return a hint of insert position, which can be later
  pass back to optimize inserts.
- Memtable will maintain a map from prefix to hints and pass the hint
  via `InsertWithHint()` if `memtable_insert_prefix_extractor` is non-null.

Test Plan: `make all check`. Will add more test and benchmarks in later
PR.
