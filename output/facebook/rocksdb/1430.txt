32 bit build is broken due to use of pedantic /WX flag in compile options.
There is a couple(not too many)warnings about casts from int64 to int or std::size_t. Naturally, GCC never warns about conversion errors, you can cast long longs to  chars, so this only pops up on Windows.

The easiest way to fix broken build seems to be to provide way to compile with less pedantic settings. Ideally, CMakeLists.txt could provide a way not to force own compiler flags, except the absolutely necessary ones (for gcc, this seems to be --std=c++11)

Alternatively, one could fix the warnings and use appropriate data types instead of int64 everywhere.
