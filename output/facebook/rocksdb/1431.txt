Hi,

Together with @thatsafunnyname we've noticed optimistic transactions failing to commit straight after reopening a RocksDB. We were able to reduce the problem to a simple reproducer and add it as a unit test to optimistic_transactions_test.cc.

We believe this is a regression introduced in a400336, and can be reproduced reliably.

The transaction fails with `Operation failed. Try again.: Transaction could not
check for conflicts for operation at SequenceNumber 1 as the MemTable
only contains changes newer than SequenceNumber 2.  Increasing the value
of the max_write_buffer_number_to_maintain option could reduce the
frequency of this error` error.

We believe the problem is caused by creating a memtable with a wrong sequence number (an off by one error).

mdlugajczyk/rocksdb@5ebfd2623a01e69a4cbeae3ed2b788f2a84056ad includes the test demonstrating the problem and a proposed solution.
