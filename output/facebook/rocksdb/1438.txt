Summary: Changed BuildTable() (used for flush) to (1) add range
tombstones to the aggregator, which is used by CompactionIterator to
determine which keys can be removed; and (2) add aggregator's range
tombstones to the table that is output for the flush.

Test Plan: flush_job_test, also tested together with end-to-end tests in
D63927
