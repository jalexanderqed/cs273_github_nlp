Hi,

It would be great to have a binary distribution available, that would include multi-platform builds (linux, macosx) and bindings (java, etc).

Earlier, I have made an attempt on an automated build VM environment setup using Vagrant / Ansible: https://github.com/phraktle/rocksdb-build â€“ this might serve as useful starting point, but I don't have time to maintain this.

Thanks,
  Viktor
