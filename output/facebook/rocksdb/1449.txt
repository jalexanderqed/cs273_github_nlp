Summary:

Implement a insert hint into skip-list to hint insert position. This is
to optimize for the write workload where there are multiple stream of
sequential writes. For example, there is a stream of keys of a1, a2,
a3... but also b1, b2, b2... Each stream are not neccessary strictly
sequential, but can get reorder a little bit. User can specify a prefix
extractor and the `SkipListRep` can thus maintan a hint for each of the
stream for fast insert into memtable.

This is the internal implementation part. See #1419 for the interface part.
See inline comments for details.

Test Plan:
See the new tests.
