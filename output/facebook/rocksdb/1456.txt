During Get()/MultiGet(), build up a RangeDelAggregator with range
tombstones as we search through live memtable, immutable memtables, and
SST files. This aggregator is then used by memtable.cc's SaveValue() and
GetContext::SaveValue() to check whether keys are covered.

added tests for Get on memtables/files; end-to-end tests mainly in https://reviews.facebook.net/D64761
