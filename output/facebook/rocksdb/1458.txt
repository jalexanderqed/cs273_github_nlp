Opening existing RocksDB attempts recovery from log files, which uses
wrong sequence number to create the memtable. This is a regression
introduced in change a400336.

This change includes a test demonstrating the problem, without the fix
the test fails with "Operation failed. Try again.: Transaction could not
check for conflicts for operation at SequenceNumber 1 as the MemTable
only contains changes newer than SequenceNumber 2.  Increasing the value
of the max_write_buffer_number_to_maintain option could reduce the
frequency of this error"

This change is a joint effort by Peter 'Stig' Edwards @thatsafunnyname
and me.
