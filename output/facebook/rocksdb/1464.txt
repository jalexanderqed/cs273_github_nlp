Summary:

Note: reviewed in  https://reviews.facebook.net/D65115

- DBIter maintains a range tombstone accumulator. We don't cleanup obsolete tombstones yet, so if the user seeks back and forth, the same tombstones would be added to the accumulator multiple times.
- DBImpl::NewInternalIterator() (used to make DBIter's underlying iterator) adds memtable/L0 range tombstones, L1+ range tombstones are added on-demand during NewSecondaryIterator() (see D62205)
- DBIter uses ShouldDelete() when advancing to check whether keys are covered by range tombstones
