In ForwardIterator::SeekInternal(), we may end up passing empty Slice representing an internal key to InternalKeyComparator::Compare.
and when we try to extract the user key from this empty Slice, we will create a slice with size = 0 - 8 ( which will overflow and cause us to read invalid memory as well )
 
Scenarios to reproduce these issues are in the unit tests
