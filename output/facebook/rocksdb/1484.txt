This fixes a correctness issue where ranges with same begin key would overwrite each other.

This diff uses InternalKey as TombstoneMap's key such that all tombstones have unique keys even when their start keys overlap. We also update TombstoneMap to use an internal key comparator.

End-to-end tests pass and are here (https://gist.github.com/ajkr/851ffe4c1b8a15a68d33025be190a7d9) but cannot be included yet since the DeleteRange() API is yet to be checked in. Note both tests failed before this fix.
