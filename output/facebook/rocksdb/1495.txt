It may be possible for a scenario to arise where stale WAL logs are deleted out of order. This has the potential to create a gap in the logs read from on recovery.

consider scenario:
transaction is prepared in log A.
transaction is committed in log B.
current log is C, A and B are release.
log B is deleted.
recovery happens.

In this scenario the transaction would be recovered as if is had not been committed because we cannot have reliable knowledge that only log C was needed for recovery. It IS possible to detect that log B was missing and that all logs before must have been released in the previous incarnation. We use this knowledge to clear all recovered transactions when we detect a gap.
