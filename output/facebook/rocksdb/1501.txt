Adjusted AddToBuilder() to take lower_bound and upper_bound, which serve two purposes: (1) only range deletions overlapping with the interval [lower_bound, upper_bound) will be added to the output file, and (2) the output file's boundaries will not be extended before lower_bound or after upper_bound. Our computation of lower_bound/upper_bound consider both subcompaction boundaries and previous/next files within the subcompaction.

Test cases are here (level subcompactions: https://gist.github.com/ajkr/63c7eae3e9667c5ebdc0a7efb74ac332, and universal subcompactions: https://gist.github.com/ajkr/5a62af77c4ebe4052a1955c496d51fdb) but can't be included in this diff as they depend on committing the API first. They fail before this change and pass after.
