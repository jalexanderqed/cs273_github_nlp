I test this example locally and it run failed.  After remove the assert in code,  the output is below:

chenhengdeMacBook-Pro:examples chenheng$ ./compaction_filter_example
FilterMerge(0)
FilterMerge(1)
FilterMerge(1)
FilterMerge(1)
FilterMerge(1)
Merge(data1)
Merge(data2)
FilterMerge(3)
filter.count_ = 0
filter.merge_count_ = 6


I am a newbie for rocksdb,  is there anything wrong i make?
