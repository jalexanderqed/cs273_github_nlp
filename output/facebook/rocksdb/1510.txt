rocksdb performance is shown.

i have a couple of questions regarding the setup:

1.   2 FusionIO devices in SW RAID 0 that can do ~200k 4kb read/second at peak
      What is the write performance of the devices? 
       is 200k 4kb read/second at peak is for each device or for both of them?

2.  Machine has 144 GB of RAM
     1G rocksdb block cache
     Is the whole 144 GB can be used for data caching ? if not,  what is the difference between the 2 lines

3.  total database size is 800GB
    but in Test1: total data size 481 GB 
    why there is a missmatch?

4. Difference in performance between Test1 and Test2
    In first Scenario the Write amplification is 2 (first the DB is being written to disc. Then it is being read          again, merge sorted, and being writtent again). is it true?
   In the second scenario, the WA is at least 2, but merge sort is very quick, becaese there are no overlaps.
   the difference in Throughput is 80MB/s vs 370MB/s.
    So the whole difference is because the SW merge-sort is very slow?
    Also , what are the DB parametrs? (compaction type, number of levels, MaxLevelRatio etc')

Thanks a lot.
