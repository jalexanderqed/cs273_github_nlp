Summary:
It is hard to measure acutal memory usage by std containers. Even
providing a custom allocator will miss count some of the usage. Here we
only do a wild guess on its memory usage.

Test Plan:
Have a piece of custom code to open a DB, insert multiple keys with hint
and verify the number is report through
DB::Properties::kCurSizeAllMemTables property.
