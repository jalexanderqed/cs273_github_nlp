Hello everyone,

Can RocksDB work on Ramdisk. Today I tried to store rocksdb in RAMdisk (8GB / Macbook Pro 2014 with 16GB RAM), and the program always crashes (segmentation fault).

I did not changed anything. Before, one line of code is:

``path += "/testdb/";``

and now it is:

``path += "/Volumes/ram_disk/testdb/";``

I tested my RAMdisk in command line, indeed I can read/write on that.

Can rocksdb work with ramdisk, or something is wrong with my programming?

Thank you very much,
