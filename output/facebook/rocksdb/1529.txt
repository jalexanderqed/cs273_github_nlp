Summary:
This has been unused since D42069 but kept around for backward
compatibility. I think it is unlikely anyone will use a much older version of
RocksDB for restore than they use for backup, so I propose removing it. It is
also causing recurring confusion, e.g., https://www.facebook.com/groups/rocksdb.dev/permalink/980454015386446/

Ported from https://reviews.facebook.net/D60735

Test Plan:
unit tests, also verified compatibility of this change by backing
up with an older version (that includes LATEST_BACKUP) and restoring with this
version.
