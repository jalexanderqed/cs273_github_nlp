When calling StatisticsImpl::HistogramInfo::getMergedHistogram(), if
there is a dying thread, which is calling
ThreadLocalPtr::StaticMeta::OnThreadExit() to merge its thread values to
HistogramInfo, deadlock will occur. Because the former try to hold
merge_lock then ThreadMeta::mutex_, but the later try to hold
ThreadMeta::mutex_ then merge_lock. In short, the locking order isn't
the same.

This patch addressed this issue by releasing merge_lock before folding
thread values.
