I have a rather large database of about 3Tb in size and billions of rows. It was created using `PrepareForBulkLoad()` options set.

Trying to reopen database (even in read-only mode) and either positioning iterator to the first key or reading any key ends up in quick (minutes) allocation of the whole RAM (32Gb) and OOM.

I experimented with `BlockBasedTableOptions` but it doesn't seem to help.

Attached LOG dumped every 60 seconds. It was made with `disable_auto_compactions = true;` option when trying to position iterator to the first key. Iterator's options are:
```
                ro.managed = true;
                ro.fill_cache = false;
                ro.verify_checksums = false;
```
but I tried many other combinations without any luck.

What are the best options to read large database without getting into OOM? I use current rocksdb version as of commit a0deec960f3a8190831c673e5ba998fe6fb7ea90
