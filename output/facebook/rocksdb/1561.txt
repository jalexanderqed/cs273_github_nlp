Summary:
This PR is based on @nbronson's diff with small
modifications to wire it up with existing interface. Comparing to
previous version, this approach works better for inserting keys in
decreasing order or updating the same key, and impose less restriction
to the prefix extractor.

---- Summary from original diff ----

This diff introduces a single InlineSkipList::Insert that unifies
the existing sequential insert optimization (prev_), concurrent insertion,
and insertion using externally-managed insertion point hints.

There's a deep symmetry between insertion hints (cursors) and the
concurrent algorithm.  In both cases we have partial information from
the recent past that is likely but not certain to be accurate.  This diff
introduces the struct InlineSkipList::Splice, which encodes predecessor
and successor information in the same form that was previously only used
within a single call to InsertConcurrently.  Splice holds information
about an insertion point that can be used to leverage locality between
subsequent inserts.  If a call to Insert(k1, splice) is followed by
Insert(k2, splice), the second call's cost is O(log D), where D is the
distance (number of intervening nodes) from k1 to k2.

Although the insert algorithm is now unified between single-threaded
and concurrent, the choice of whether to use compare-and-swap must be
made at compile time via a template parameter.  (Note that the Splice
instance itself is not concurrent.)  Concurrent insert no longer needs
to invalidate the sequential insertion cache (the former prev_).

Test Plan:
make sure it pass inlineskiplist_test and other existing unit tests.
