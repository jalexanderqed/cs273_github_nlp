Summary:
Current write stalling system has the problem of lacking of positive feedback if the restricted rate is already too low. Users sometimes stack in very low slowdown value. With the diff, we add a positive feedback (increasing the slowdown value) if we recover from slowdown state back to normal. To avoid the positive feedback to keep the slowdown value to be to high, we add issue a negative feedback every time we are close to the stop condition. Experiments show it is easier to reach a relative balance than before.

Also increase level0_stop_writes_trigger default from 24 to 32. Since level0_slowdown_writes_trigger default is 20, stop trigger 24 only gives four files as the buffer time to slowdown writes. In order to avoid stop in four files while 20 files have been accumulated, the slowdown value must be very low, which is amost the same as stop. It also doesn't give enough time for the slowdown value to converge. Increase it to 32 will smooth out the system.

Test Plan: Run

./db_bench --benchmarks=fillrandom --num=10000000 --write_buffer_size=4000000 --level0_slowdown_writes_trigger=16 -max_write_buffer_number=8 --max_background_flushes=8 --level0_stop_writes_trigger=24 --max_bytes_for_level_base=10000000000

Before we'll stuck in very low slowdown value. Now we can reach a balance with a much higher slowdown value
