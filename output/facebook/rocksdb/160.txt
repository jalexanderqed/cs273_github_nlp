As you said, compaction_filter is only used in compaction stage.

When I worked with leveldb, I added a delete_policy patch to support TTL. It's like compaction_filter, but it's also used in Get()/Iterator operation. 

Patch:
https://github.com/allenlz/leveldb/commit/52f561cad7b231ba5ddf9fb8a314011be5ccc774

Demo with a CustomComparator:

https://github.com/allenlz/leveldb-demo/blob/master/expired_time_demo.cpp

Would you add full TTL support in future? I think adding another filter will OK.
