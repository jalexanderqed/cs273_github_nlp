I've tested this on both OSX 10.9 and an Ubuntu 13.10 server VM. Both appear to build without errors, but _make check_ fails with the following:

==== Test TableTest.ApproximateOffsetOfCompressed
Value 10029 is not in range [2000, 3000]
table/table_test.cc:1154: Assertion failure Between(c.ApproximateOffsetOf("k03"), 2000, 3000)
make: **\* [check] Error 1
