RocksDB has a very big number of different configuration options that we added to make it flexible and suitable for various workloads and environments (in-memory, SSD, point lookups, etc). Configuring all these options to get the most out of RocksDB is not easy and requires very high familiarity with RocksDB internals.

On the other hand, RocksDB's default options are inherited from LevelDB and not suitable for any high-performance server workload.

We should invest some time in making RocksDB's options easier to configure and understand. For starting proposals, see: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Proposals-on-Improving-Rocksdb's-Options

We're welcoming all contributions and thoughts in this effort.
