Hi,

as soon as I use 'max_log_file_size', no LOG file is opened on database creation.

Here is a very simple program. Important for reproducing: The "/tmp/testdb" directory must _not_ exists. Thus relying on the create_if_missing.

``` cpp
#include "rocksdb/db.h"

int main() {
    rocksdb::DB* db;
    rocksdb::Options options;
    options.max_log_file_size = 100 * 1024 * 1024;
    options.create_if_missing = true;
    rocksdb::Status status = rocksdb::DB::Open(options, "/tmp/testdb", &db);
    assert(status.ok());
}
```

I did a look at auto_roll_logger and could see that the database directory is not present when the logfile is opened => error on creating the file => no logging.

However, If no 'max_log_file_size' is used the directory is created.
So my suggestion would be to move env->CreateDir(dbname) just a few lines up, so it is always called regardless of the options.
