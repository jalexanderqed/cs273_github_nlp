Hello!

Noticed an interesting situation for max_open_files can specify the number of open files larger than allowed by the system. For ubuntu default 1024 (ulimit-n).

Appears quite unexpectedly. For FIFO style, you can choose options max_size = 200Gb write_buffer = 100Mb, 100Gb will be recorded when an error "Too many open files".
