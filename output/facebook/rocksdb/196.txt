When I use db_bench tool to benchmark the rocksdb v3.1

I configured the benchmark as readrandom, firsty load the data and then do readrandrom. 

And I found the read operations read almost data from memory but not through the SSD, the read data always 0 from command 'iostat'.

Do you think this is strange? How can I make it read data through the SSD?
