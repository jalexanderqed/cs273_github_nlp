Thanks for open sourcing your work.

I think it would be extremely helpful if OSX were a supported platform for the purposes of _experimentation_.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts as I've begun preparing a patch that takes this approach with some tradeoffs, notably:
- only microsecond timer accuracy
- sacrificing some of the `posix_fadvise` hinting that is supported on other platforms
