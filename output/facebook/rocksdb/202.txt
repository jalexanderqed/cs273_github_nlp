I have run make all . And it went fine.
But when i started to build the java with make rocksdbjava, its giving me the following error:

/usr/bin/ld: db/builder.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against `.rodata' can not be used when making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC
db/builder.o: error adding symbols: Bad value
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: **\* [rocksdbjava] Error 1
l
Im using 64 bit machine with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I have installed all the perquisite dependency mentioned in the rocksdb installation page

Please tell me how to resolve this issue?
