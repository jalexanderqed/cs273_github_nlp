Hey guys,
                 I am playing around with the Rocksdb JNI version. One of the requirements we have is, being able to have a single monolithic shared library that contains all the dependencies (snappy, bzip) - for portability aspect. I played around with snappy, compiled it as an archive file (.a) and included it as as static dependency while compiling the rocksdbjava JNI shared library. Do you recommend this approach ? I was thinking of adding a new target to the MakeFile (which will download snappy and link it statically with rocksdb JNI) and contribute back. Also, how do you control the compression algorithm being using the java API? I don't see an option to do this.

Thanks in advance,
Naveen
