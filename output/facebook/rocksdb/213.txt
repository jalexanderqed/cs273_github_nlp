Hey guys,
                 I compiled RocksDb without snappy and tried using it from java. When I set the compression type of snappy (I was expecting an error), the put and get options still seem to work without any issues. 

``` java
val options = new Options();
   options.setCompressionType(CompressionType.SNAPPY_COMPRESSION).setCreateIfMissing(true);
var db = RocksDB.open(options, "testdbpath");
```

Is the compression type silently ignored ?
