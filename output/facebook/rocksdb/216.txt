HI,

I try to make version 3.3 and master branch, there is an error occurs.
# 

table/cuckoo_table_builder.cc:335:34: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true
      [-Werror,-Wtautological-compare]
    while (bucket_to_replace_pos >= 0) {
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^  ~
1 error generated.
# make:  [table/cuckoo_table_builder.o] Error 1

Maybe I can change my compile flag, but I think you should want to know this issue.

I build in mac os.

Thanks.
