hi all,

I compile rocksdb on i386 server(Ubuntu 14.04) ,  the following  error happened :

In file included from util/env_posix.cc:36:0:
./include/rocksdb/env.h:467:18: error: ‘virtual rocksdb::Status rocksdb::WritableFile::RangeSync(off_t, off_t)’ was hidden [-Werror=overloaded-virtual]
   virtual Status RangeSync(off_t offset, off_t nbytes) {
                  ^
util/env_posix.cc:824:18: error:   by ‘virtual rocksdb::Status rocksdb::{anonymous}::PosixWritableFile::RangeSync(off64_t, off64_t)’ [-Werror=overloaded-virtual]
   virtual Status RangeSync(off64_t offset, off64_t nbytes) {
                  ^  
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors

any idea about this?
