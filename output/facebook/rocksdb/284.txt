Hi,

Seeing this error during make:

In file included from db/write_controller.cc:6:0:
./db/write_controller.h:65:3: error: looser throw specifier for 'virtual rocksdb::StopWriteToken::~StopWriteToken()'
./db/write_controller.h:50:11: error:   overriding 'virtual rocksdb::WriteControllerToken::~WriteControllerToken() noexcept (true)'
./db/write_controller.h:72:3: error: looser throw specifier for 'virtual rocksdb::DelayWriteToken::~DelayWriteToken()'
./db/write_controller.h:50:11: error:   overriding 'virtual rocksdb::WriteControllerToken::~WriteControllerToken() noexcept (true)'

Verified it on Mac OSX and Linux. Can someone please take a look if some recent commit has broken the build?
