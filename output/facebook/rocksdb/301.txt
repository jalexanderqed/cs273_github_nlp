previous answer:
  DB operations unaffected by backup
new question  [what about DB operations during backup using BackupableDB?]
  BackupableDB "consumes" DB interface, should use backupable_db for post backup DB operations,
  how can this be? is there not a point in backup where DB becomes invalid?
  possibly during a DB Put/Get?
  is it required to use BackupEngine directly to safely do DB operations during and after backup? 

BackupEngine example: shows "delete db" after CreateNewBackup
    backup_engine->CreateNewBackup(db);
    delete db;
    delete backup_engine;
is this required or can the "db" continue to be used during and after CreateNewBackup?
