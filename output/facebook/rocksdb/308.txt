Once the ongoing RocksDB JNI work is committed (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/235), I'm looking at publishing RocksDB's JNI libraries to Maven central so that the work can be consumed by other Java projects.

My proposal is to use [Sonatype](http://www.sonatype.org/)'s open source Maven repo as the host for RocksDB JARs. This repo gets mirrored into Maven central. The artifacts will be published under the 'org.rocksdb' group.

Does this sound OK with everyone?
