If I understand correctly the Java BloomFilter class (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/java/org/rocksdb/BloomFilter.java) is no longer needed and the configuration information that it used to hold has been re-purposed inside BlockBasedTableConfig class. This should probably be deleted. Also can someone please update the Java Wiki page which is now severely lacking...
