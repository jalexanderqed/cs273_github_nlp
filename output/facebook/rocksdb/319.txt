This commit includes the support for the following functionalities:
- Single Get/Put operations
- WriteBatch operations
- Single iterator functionality
- Open database with column families
- Open database with column families Read/Only
- Create column family
- Drop column family
- Properties of column families
- Listing of column families
- Fully backwards comptabile implementation
- Multi Iterator support
- MultiGet
- KeyMayExist
- Option to create missing column families on open

In addition there is are two new Tests:
- Test of ColumnFamily functionality
- Test of Read only feature to open subsets of column families
- Basic test to test the KeyMayExist feature

What is not supported currently using RocksJava:
- Custom ColumnFamilyOptions

I decided to file a pull request w/o the missing two features to omit
some merging trouble.

The following targets work as expected:
- make rocksdbjava
- make jtest

Test environment: Ubuntu 14.04(LTS, x64), Java 1.7.0_65(OpenJDK IcedTea 2.5.2), g++ 4.8.2, kernel 3.13.0-35-generix
