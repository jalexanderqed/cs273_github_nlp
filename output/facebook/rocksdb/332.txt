I am using RocksDB for about two months in this configuration:
OS X Server 10.9.5/2.3 MGhz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, 2TB Hard Drive.
GoLang (https://golang.org/dl/) 1.2.1
RockDB 3.3.0

The reason to switch to RockDB from LevelDB was about 10 times performance increase when generating a database.

Recently I updated the GoLang to 1.3.3 - the latest stable version.

I made extensive tests with different permutations of following:
1) go version go1.2.2 darwin/amd64
2) go version go1.3.2 darwin/amd64
3) go version go1.3.3 darwin/amd64
with
RocksDB:
3.3.0 (7/10/2014) AND also
3.5.0 (9/3/2014)

I can generate the DB but reading it:
2) and 3) create a new directory with original name + "se)." to it. Additionally I see all content moved to this new directory and trying to read the DB AGAIN returns an error because the DB content is not there but in this new directory.

A NOTE: this directory created comes with different names: "se).", "aterhole)." which seems random.

The following combination is working OK:
go version go1.2.2 darwin/amd64
3.3.0 (7/10/2014) AND also
3.5.0 (9/3/2014)
