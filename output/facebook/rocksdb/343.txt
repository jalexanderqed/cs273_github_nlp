Hi,

It seems that `c_test.c` does not clean up the `rocksdb_mergeoperator_t` it creates [here](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/db/c_test.c#L658).  If it is cleaned up with a call to `rocksdb_mergeoperator_destroy` at the end of the block then a segfault will occur.  Should merge operators be cleaned up by calling `rocksdb_mergeoperator_destroy`?  If not, what is the purpose of `rocksdb_mergeoperator_destroy`, and what is the proper way to clean up merge operators?
