Preparational pull request. The main point about these changes is
to enable RocksJava in a next step to provide custom ColumnFamilyOptions.
DBOptions and ColumnFamilyOptions are now available as well as Interfaces
which describe those methods.

Methods in interfaces and class definitions of DBOptions and ColumnFamilyOptions
are ordered according to C++ implementation.

Optimize methods were ported to Java. (OptimizeForPointLookup,
OptimizeLevelCompaction, OptimizeUniversalCompaction).

To align BuiltinComparator with every other Enum it was moved to
a separate file.

A new test was introduced which includes some basic testing of
ColumnFamilyOptions and DBOptions.

Note: The changes are fully downwards compatible.
