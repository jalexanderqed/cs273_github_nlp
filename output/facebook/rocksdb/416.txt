commit 44f0ff3 introduces the use of FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, which according to http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fallocate.2.html was introduced with the 2.6.38 kernel.  this breaks compilation on rhel6 where 3.5.1 built fine.

i don't have a patch, as i'm not sure which approach is best from a code maintenance perspective:

1) check FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE when deciding to define ROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT

2) more conditional goop at the single point of use in env_posix.cc
-#ifdef ROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT
+#if defined(ROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT) && defined(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)

3) dummy definition:
# if defined(ROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT) && !defined(FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE)

  #define FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE 0
# endif
