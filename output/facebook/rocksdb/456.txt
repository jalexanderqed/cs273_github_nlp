Hi RocksDB team,

I'm experimenting with RocksDB C API.  The rocksdb_get() method returns a buffer of data.  I'm wondering if the caller should free this buffer after usage.  The "rocksdb/c.h" says this buffer is malloc()ed.  However the given c example code "examples/c_simple_example.c" doesn't call free afterwards.

Thanks!
