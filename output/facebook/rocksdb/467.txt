I have been trying to implement Counter using RocksDB
What i have implemented is a simple hit Counter using rest-Express which increments the counter
I have two counters in place 
A Rocksdb Counter using merge operator
and a simple java atomic-Long Counter.
the Rocksdb counter does not store the right values compared with the atomic-Long counter
I fired the requests using Apache Benchmark with high concurrency
I'm not sure if the implementation is right or if there is some other issues here
I have the sample code of my implementation here
