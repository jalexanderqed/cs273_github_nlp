There are two features which make me consider RocksDB over LevelDB for the current project that I am working on. 
One is 
Options::compaction_filter

Described here:

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations

"Options::compaction_filter - Allows an application to modify/delete a key-value during background compaction. The client must provide compaction_filter_factory if it requires a new compaction filter to be used for different compaction processes. Client should specify only one of filter or factory."

I would like to specify a filter to signal that older records (older than lets say 90 days assuming that I put a time stamp on the records or use a column family) should be deleted on compaction.

There does not seem to be a way to do this in Java and the Options:compaction_filter property is missing on the Java version of Options.
