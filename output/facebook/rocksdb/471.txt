Prior to this the native library loader instance didn`t
care about a state. So if library loading was called multiple
times, multiple copies of the shared object were put into
the tmp folder and loaded into the JVM.

This changed within this commit to the following behavior:
- library loading is now synchronized
- library is loaded within the first call
- if loading was successful the library loaded sets a flag
- every subsequent call checks for a boolean flag indicating if there was
  already a successful attempt
