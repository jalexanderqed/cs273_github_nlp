I just spent a fair bit of time and tweaking debugging poor bulk loading performance in rocksdb. One thing that tripped me up is that [simply calling IncreaseParallelism on the options doesn't increase the number of available threads for background flushes](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/62ad0a9b19f0be4cefa70b6b32876e764b7f3c11/util/options.cc#L581). Once I realized this and set a high maximum number of flushes I was able to quadruple my application's throughput! rocksdb is no longer the major bottleneck in my process.

Is there any reason this doesn't happen by default? It seems particularly problematic for bulk loads.
