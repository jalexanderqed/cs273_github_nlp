hi everyone

I recently in the study of rocksdb.I find that the value of allow_mmap_reads is set to false by default and the the performance of readrandom with allow_mmap_reads=false is very lower than allow_mmap_reads=true,because of rocksdb uses mmap to load all the data of file to os buffer in the beginning.can anybody answers to me why the value of allow_mmap_reads is set to false by default? this setting can improving the performance in some cases? 

Ask this question because of leveldb without this parameter, it can using mmap by default. so i want to know the purpose of doing so by rocksdb.
