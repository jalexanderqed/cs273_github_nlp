We're doing a block cache size influence on the performance,and we found that increase the size of block cache almost has no effect on performance, even in large quantity of the data set.

because of the influence of os page cache? What circumstances increase block cache size can obtain better performance?

In addition, I found that  Rocksdb's [Performance Benchmarks](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks) said that the block cache size is 1G,But the block cache size is set to 1048576 of actual test, and I read the code found that the unit of size maybe byte, is that right?
_**cs=1048576;** of=500000; si=1000000; ./db_bench --benchmarks=readrandom --disable_seek_compaction=1 --mmap_read=0 --statistics=1 --histogram=1 --num=$r --threads=$t --value_size=$vs --block_size=$bs **--cache_size=$cs**_
