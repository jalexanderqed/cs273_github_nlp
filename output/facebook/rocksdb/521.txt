If rocksdb is opened in read only mode, is read performance strictly linear with the number of reading threads? I'm not observing this in practice. I think that the problem in my case is IO latency and bounding, but I wanted to check that there are not any locks which might limit the overall throughput of a single instance of rocksdb.

I'd like to open only one and use many threads for concurrent reads so as to avoid duplicating cached metadata about the db.

What is the optimal way to achieve truly parallel read performance using read only mode?
