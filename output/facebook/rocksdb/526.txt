using the database API after the database has been closed can result in a segmentation violation.
Below, you find an example bt end point from a corresponding core dump

```
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  rocksdb_get (db=<optimized out>, options=0x2480780, key=0x7f4f20d0f4fb "", keylen=6, vallen=0x3e577a0, errptr=0x246dc30) at db/c.cc:727
727   Status s = db->rep->Get(options->rep, Slice(key, keylen), &tmp);

```

It's not a big issue, but an exception would be nicer. 
The problem occurs in a context where there are many reader threads and 1 thread closes the database, while the others only realise this has happened a bit later.
