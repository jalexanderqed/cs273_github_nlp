Summary:
Before this change: overflowing size_t values led to a checked Exception.

After that change:

size_t overflows on 32-Bit architecture, throw now an IllegalArgumentException,
which removes the necessity for a developer to catch these Exceptions explicitly.

This is especially an advantage for developers targeting 64-Bit systems because
it is not necessary anymore to catch exceptions which are never thrown on a 64-Bit
system.

Test Plan:
make clean jclean rocksdbjava jtest
mvn -f rocksjni.pom package
