Is there a known issue with random writes on RocksDb Java?  I have recently ported an application from the Java port of LevelDb and see comparable performance for sequential writes, but significantly worse performance for random writes (3-4 times worse and degrading over time).  In my scenario, I'm batch loading about 10 million rows of data that is randomly ordered (basically building an index to another RocksDB table).

The Java benchmarks you've published do not include the numbers from the random write tests: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksJava-Performance-on-Flash-Storage. Can you elaborate (or maybe publish the data for all the benchmarks you run on C++?).

I've been using 3.8 on OSX 10.9.4.

thanks much.
