This was crossposted to https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb/issues/24 and @rdallman suggest to make a definitive last key, I tried it didn't work(assuming my tests are right) https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb/issues/24#issuecomment-85105132 (related tests: https://github.com/yinhm/gorocksdb/commit/f90f8600b28466da6fa4b1aa37c7f6cae9bcb129)

I know this maybe Go client implementation specific question, still, help me.

This has been bugs me several days,  in TestCustomSliceTransform[1], if I open the old database without Destroy it first, then do the same iteration(without Put changes), the tests fails.

The docs[2] says: "If there is one or more keys in the database matching prefix of lookup_key, RocksDB will place the iterator to the key equal or **larger than lookup_key** of the same prefix, as for total ordering mode."

I'm not sure is this the expect behavior, it so, how do we do SeekToLast(), isn't this make SeekToLast() useless. 

```
$go test -run TestCustomSliceTransform
