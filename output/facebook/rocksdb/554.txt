I am using Centos 6 in a Docker file. When I run the following as part of my Docker file, it fails.

```
make rocksdbjavastatic
```

Unfortunately, I don't have time to replicate the error and paste it here.

The issue it complains about is `unmappable character for encoding ASCII` in some of the java test files (the files with Chinese characters IIRC). I was able to fix the issue locally by modifying the [java Makefile line 170](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/java/Makefile#L170) to

```
javac -encoding UTF-8 -cp $(MAIN_CLASSES):$(JAVA_TESTCLASSPATH) -d $(TEST_CLASSES)\
```
