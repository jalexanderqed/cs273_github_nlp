Fixes #55, and retains the fix for #11
- I didn't use awk, same goal can be achieved with cat, and it seems easier to read.
- Checking whether git exists is safer with "command -v"
- Last check about build_version.cc is changed/missing is effectively the same with overriding it. I directly write the output to util/build_version.cc
