I would like to know if the rocksdb data is persistent across process restart.
If there is way, can you please share the steps.

TEST CASE:
Rocksdb Version: 3.10

An instance of rocksdb is started with the follwing options:
WAL = enabled
WAL dir = rocksdb dir
Sync = true
check_if_missing = true

Rocksdb directory and WAL directory are persisted on SSD.
Some I/O is performed to the rocksdb, WAL file gets populated and SST file is created.
The process is killed at this point.

Rocksdb is restarted with check_if_missing = false option this time.
Rocksdb restart returns an error "Invalid argument, <DB location> does not exist (create_if_missing is false)"
DB directory is present and all the files are present in the DB, but restart fails.

Can you please confirm if data persistence is supported across process restart?
