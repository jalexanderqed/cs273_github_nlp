Has anyone had this problem when trying to run valgrind on a program built with rocksdb?

``` text
vex amd64->IR: unhandled instruction bytes: 0x8F 0xEA 0xF8 0x10 0xC9 0x3 0x1D 0x0
==32477== valgrind: Unrecognised instruction at address 0x5b284e.
==32477==    at 0x5B284E: rocksdb::NewLRUCache(unsigned long, int, int) (cache.cc:167)
==32477==    by 0x5B2B0F: rocksdb::NewLRUCache(unsigned long) (cache.cc:529)
==32477==    by 0x5826C0: rocksdb::BlockBasedTableFactory::BlockBasedTableFactory(rocksdb::BlockBasedTableOptions const&) (block_based_table_factory.cc:36)
```

I'm perplexed. Making everything worse, I can run valgrind on another system, but it reports no errors and the segfault I'm trying to trace never happens on it.
