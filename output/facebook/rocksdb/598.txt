In Stats class of DbBenchmark.java, the start time(start_) and finish time(finish_) are captured with "System.nanoTime()" which is in nanoseconds range. But elapsed time with second as unit in "report" function is calculated as " double elapsed = (finish_ - start_) \* 1e-6;" . I think this is erroneous as it should be calculated as " double elapsed = (finish_ - start_) \* 1e-9;"

I guess it got mistakenly copied from db_bench.cc which start and finish time are both defined in microseconds range.
