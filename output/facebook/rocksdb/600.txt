On HEAD of `master` when running `make clean jclean check` I get a build failure on Mac OS X about too many open files:

```

```

This is a relatively recent development and did not occur previously.

`sysctl kern.maxfiles` reports `12288` on my system, and after the build fails `lsof | wc -l` reports `11481`. Is it possible that building rocks and running check requires opening another 807 files? Or is rocks leaking file handles?
