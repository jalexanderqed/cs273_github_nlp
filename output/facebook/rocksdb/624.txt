Hi, all.

I am trying to dump info from an SST file.
The key-value pairs are in the form 
"key-tttt-xxxx" : "val-tttt-xxxx" (xxxx is index numbers, starting from 0)

== 1 ==
However, for some files, I got assertion failure when I do

./sst_dump --command=raw --file=/path/to/file

It complains:
"sst_dump: ./db/dbformat.h:89: rocksdb::Slice rocksdb::ExtractUserKey(const rocksdb::Slice&): Assertion `internal_key.size() >= 8' failed."

Besides, "./sst_dump --command=scan ... "  works fine.

== 2 ==
Also, I tried to use SstFileReader class to dump the table, for example

```
SstFileReader sst_reader(sst_file, false, false);
sst_reader.DumpTable(dump_file);
```

But it had segmentation fault. With gdb, the backtrace is

```

```

```

Any idea why? 
I guess I have to understand more about the internal key/value representation before figuring out the causes.

Thanks!
