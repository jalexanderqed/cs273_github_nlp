On an Ubuntu 14.04.2 32 bit system with gcc 4.8.2, I get the following build error:

```
util/crc32c.cc: In function ‘void rocksdb::crc32c::Fast_CRC32(uint64_t*, const uint8_t**)’:
util/crc32c.cc:318:39: error: ‘_mm_crc32_u64’ was not declared in this scope
   *l = _mm_crc32_u64(*l, LE_LOAD64(*p));
```

I don't know if it is supposed to exist on a 32 bit system or not, but `__SSE4_2__` is defined, so the code assumes it exists.
