It seems that there is a missing include with g++-4.7:

```
$ make CXX=g++-4.7
g++-4.7 -g -Wall -Werror -I. -I./include -std=gnu++11  -DROCKSDB_PLATFORM_POSIX  -DOS_LINUX -fno-builtin-memcmp -DROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT -DGFLAGS -DZLIB -DBZIP2   -DHAVE_JEMALLOC -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -momit-leaf-frame-pointer -Woverloaded-virtual -c db/compaction.cc -o db/compaction.o
