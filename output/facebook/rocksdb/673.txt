I've packaged RocksDB v3.11.2 for Debian/Sid. It seems to be working, but the self test fails with the following.
[ RUN      ] ColumnFamilyTest.SanitizeOptions
[       OK ] ColumnFamilyTest.SanitizeOptions (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] ColumnFamilyTest.ReadDroppedColumnFamily

My system is an amd64 but I can give you more information if requested.
