Would there be interest in a RocksDB amalgamation? The idea is similar to the SQLite amalgamation: https://www.sqlite.org/amalgamation.html

In summary, it would be a way of distributing all of RocksDB in 3 source files:
- A .h file that contains all RocksDB public headers (except c.h) concatenated
- c.h
- A .cc file that contains all RocksDB .cc files concatenated with private header inclusions expanded

The main benefit is that it provides a simple way to include RocksDB in a project. Drop in those three files and you're set.

Secondary benefits are faster compile time and possibly better compiler optimizations.

If there's interest, I will contribute a script and Makefile rule to build an amalgamation.
