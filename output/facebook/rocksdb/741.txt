  Add an optimized build config switch for faster test runs
  Change compiler options to introduce more opitmizations and be more inline with MS internal switches.
  Make appveyor build to utilize all the avaiable cores on the VM (parallel)
  Introduce new appveyor configuration for daily test runs as it would take too long
  to run db_test after each checkin even in paralell.
  With some exclusions we make it in 38 minutes. We currently fail to install ramdisk during the build.
  Add a powershell script to faicilitate paralell run for db_test cases.
