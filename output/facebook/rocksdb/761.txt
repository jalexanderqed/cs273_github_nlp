Hi I'm facing an error which is: Compression type Snappy is not linked with the binary.

I got this error while running the `simple_example` in the `examples/` directory. I simply built this by using `make simple_example`. However, this program failed at the `s.ok()` assertion. So I followed the instruction in the wiki to find out what had happened. With `s.ToString()`, I've got the error message listed previously.

It seems that I haven't got this library, so I've built it again with this option:

```
options.compression = kNoCompression;
```

But still, that error message showed up again..

Thanks for your help!
