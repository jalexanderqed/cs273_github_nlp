Summary: This patch splits the posix storage backend into Env and
the actual *File implementations. The motivation is to allow other Envs
to use posix as a library. This enables a storage backend different from
posix to split its secondary storage between a normal file system
partition managed by posix, and it own media.

Test Plan: No new functionality is added to posix Env or the library,
thus the current tests should suffice.
