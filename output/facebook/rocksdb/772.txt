Hello,
I am looking for suggestions on my RocksDB configuration.

Num of memtables = 2
Size of memtable = 16MB
Num of levels = 4
Target file size base = 64MB
Target file size multiplier = 1
max_bytes_for_level_base = 1GB
max_bytes_for_level_multiplier = 12
level0_file_num_compaction_trigger = 40
level0_slowdown_writes_trigger = 50
level0_stop_writes_trigger = 64
Average Key size = 32 Bytes
Average Value size = 80 Bytes (we work with smaller values)
Block cache size = 128MB
Compression = NO
Block Size = 16KB

The database is hosted on 128G SSD.
Expected workload is 70:30 ( Read:Write) and maximum PUT rate is around 20K ops.

Can you suggest if this configuration is optimal with respect to performance and write amplification?

Thanks.
