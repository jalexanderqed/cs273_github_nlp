  Investigation shows that WinRandomAccess aligned buffer that we use for
  unbuffered read access grows to the the size of the largest read
  and remains so for a long period of time which impacts memory
  footprint. We introduce a new DBoption random_access_max_buffer_size that
  limits the size of the buffer with 1Mb default. For reads larger
  than the option value we create one shot large buffers.
  We also implement compaction_readahead option while re-using the same
  buffer. When readahead is in effect we allocate a fixed size buffer
  and use one shot buffer for very large reads.
  We propagate both options above to the env ooptions to make them
  available for Windows environment code.
  We add a hint function that enables ReadAhead when necessary.
