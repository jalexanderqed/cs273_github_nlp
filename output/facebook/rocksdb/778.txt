- add validation is git found
- add validation is .git folder exists in project (project zip archive download without .git folder)
- get head commit SHA if git found and .git folder exists

Tested:
- configure project by CMake 3.0.0 successfully (with and without git), with project zip archive (without .git folder) and with project cloned from github
- configure project by command: cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64"
- build solution by Visual Studio
- manually validate that file utils/build_version.cc contains valid head revision value
