Summary: This patch moves all posix thread logic to separate library.
The motivation is to allow another environments to easily reuse posix
threads. HDFS wraps already posix threads; this split would simplify
this code.

Test Plan: No new functionality is added to posix Env or the threading
library, thus the current tests should suffice.
