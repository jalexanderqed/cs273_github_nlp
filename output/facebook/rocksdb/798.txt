  introduce a new DBOption random_access_max_buffer_size to limit
  the size of the random access buffer used for unbuffered access.
  Implement read ahead buffering when enabled.
  To that effect propagate compaction_readahead_size and the new option
  to the env options to make it available for the implementation.
  Add Hint() override so SetupForCompaction() call would call Hint()
  readahead can now be setup from both Hint() and EnableReadAhead()
  Add new option random_access_max_buffer_size support
  db_bench, options_helper to make it string parsable
  and the unit test.
