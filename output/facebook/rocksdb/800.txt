This mostly affects Linux since for `RandomAccessFile` it does make some file system calls to optimize for access pattern.

At `table_cache.cc` in `TableCache::GetTableReader()` the following is the sequence of calls for sequential file access:
- `RandomAccessFile` is opened
- The above is then gets wrapped into `ReadaheadRandomAccessFile`
- Which finally gets wrapped into `RandomAccessFileReader`

Then `TableCache::NewIterator` is called it calls `SetupForCompaction()` which is where it is supposed to call `Hint()`. However, `RandomAccessFileReader` does not override `Hint()` and the default implementation is called which is empty. Thus `Hint()` never reaches the `RandomAccessFile` implementation.
