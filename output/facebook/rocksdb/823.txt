  in 64-bit.

  Currently, a signed off_t type is being used for the following
  interfaces for both offset and the length in bytes:
- `Allocate`
- `RangeSync`
  
  On Linux `off_t` is automatically either 32 or 64-bit depending on
  the platform. On Windows it is always a 32-bit signed long which
  limits file access and in particular space pre-allocation
  to effectively 2 Gb.
  
  Proposal is to replace off_t with uint64_t as a portable type
  always access files with 64-bit interfaces.
  
  May need to modify posix code but lack resources to test it.
