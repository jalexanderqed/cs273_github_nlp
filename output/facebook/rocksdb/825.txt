Some times ,we write bad data into db and need rollback it ã€‚
For reader,  we can assigned the  snapshot with seqid=200. But evently  the data  with seq between seq 201 and 9800 must be deleted.  Can we  use   compaction filter  to filter them?

key: type: put seqID: 1 

key: B type: put seqID: 10000 
key: B type: put seqID: 9900<=====  make snapshot with seqID 9900
key: B type: put seqID: 9800               ||
...                                                         bad data  
                                                            bad data
                                                            || 

key: B type: put seqID: 300
key: B type: put seqID: 200<=====  make snapshot with seqID 200
... 
key: B type: put seqID: 2
