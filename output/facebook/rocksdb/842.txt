Commit f14c3363 introduced the use of GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime,
which is only available on Win8 and above. This breaks backwards runtime
compatibility with earlier Windows versions.

This commit partially reverts the aforementioned commit, guarded in a
compile-time macro. By default, this patch has no effect on the code
base. However, if the _WIN32_WINNT macro is explicitly set to a Windows
a Windows version older than Win8, then we use the backwards-compatible
implementation.
