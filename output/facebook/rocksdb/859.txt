hi, i want to know what does disable_delete_obsolete_files_ exactly mean?

case is :
1. set WAL_ttl_seconds  = 6000
2. turn options_.delete_scheduler on

if i set disable_delete_obsolete_files_  = true, then rocksdb will not delete obsolete file（LOG.old_, archieve/_, trash sstable in some dir） any more? is this right?
