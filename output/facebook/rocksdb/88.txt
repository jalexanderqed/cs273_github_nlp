https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Performance-Benchmarks states that two FusionIO cards are in play.  Not sure what models of that card you used, but they can be $10,000 each.  $20,000 disk array is a tad rich for many installation.  And FusionIO really tends to hide stupid code (ask me how I know).  Would you consider retesting with something sane … like two 7500rpm SATA drive?  You might be really, really surprised … and provide better guidance for those that consider your code.
