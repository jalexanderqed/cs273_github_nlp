It would be nice if RocksDB came with a default merge operator for appending bytes,
analogous to `stringappend`.

A common use case for a merge operation is simply storing additional values under that key.
At the same time many binary serialisation formats can read object collections when their byte-strings are simply concatenated (to support streaming applications).

`stringappend` almost handles this case, but always inserts a separating character ("," by default).
So introducing this would merely require a copy of `stringappend` with the line introducing the delimiter removed and the names updated.

I know that it seems trivial to implement this on an application level, however when using RocksJava, one has to jump through quite a few hoops to do this.

I'd be willing to create a patch for this.

Thanks :), JP
