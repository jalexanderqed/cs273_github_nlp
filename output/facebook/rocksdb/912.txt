Hi,

I'm writing a clojure wrapper for RocksJava, and am trying to automatically release snapshots in a finalizer with `releaseSnapshot`. However this causes the jvm to segfault reproducibly.
Releasing the snapshot outside the finalizer works fine.
I've tested this on rocksdbjni 3.13.1 and 4.0, both have the same problem.
The system this is running on is OS X.
Does anybody have any ideas or pointers what is happening here?

I attached the segfault log.
