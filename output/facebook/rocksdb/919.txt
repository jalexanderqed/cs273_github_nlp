i find a problem recently，when hard disk is full，rocksdb always return error：Mset set keys error, err=IO error：No space left on device， even after clean the disk，rocksdb always stay error state，

i think bg_error_ may be the reason，when bg_error_ is set error， this flag will stay error all the time，therr is no way to reset this flag. so once set bg_error_ to error status，it will always stay error all the time ,and rocksdb will not work.
can you give some suggestion about this problem?

Thanks~
