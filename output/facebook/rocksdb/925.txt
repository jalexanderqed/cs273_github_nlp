```
  // Current Requirements:
  // (1) Memtable is empty.
  // (2) All existing files (if any) have sequence number = 0.
  // (3) Key range in loaded table file don't overlap with existing
  //     files key ranges.
  // (4) No other writes happen during AddFile call, otherwise
  //     DB may get corrupted.
  // (5) Database have at least 2 levels.
```

 items 1 and 4 apply to the destination column family, not the whole db, correct?
