@siying As we has discussed on the FB page, here's the instruction to repro the issue. 

1) Sequentially insert 10 million keys to the DB
2) Spawn a thread to keep overwriting the existing keys in random order
3) Create an iterator to scan through the DB and count the number of keys found

If regular iterator is used, exactly 10 million keys will be found.
If tailing iterator is used, less than 10 million keys will be found.  (6092434 keys found in one repro)

Config used:
--num=10000000 --value_size=800 --block_size=4096 --cache_size=1048576  --open_files=500000 --write_buffer_size=134217728 --target_file_size_base=67108864 --max_write_buffer_number=3 --max_background_compactions=8 --max_bytes_for_level_base=10485760 --use_tailing_iterator=1
