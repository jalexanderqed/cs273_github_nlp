I am trying to limit the size of the Database using the rocksdb options.
Following is the configuration:
No. of Memtables = 4
Size of memtable = 4M
No. of Levels = 4
Target file size base = 4M
Target file size multiplier = 1
Max bytes for level base = 32M
Max bytes for level multiplier = 4
level0_file_num_compaction_trigger = 4
level0_slowdown_writes_trigger = 48
level0_stop_writes_trigger = 64
Block cache size = 128MB
Compression = No
Block Size = 16KB

Based on this, total size of my Database should not exceed 1GB.
I am observing that DB grows beyond this limit and uses the entire partition.
In this experiment, a partition of 2GB has been given to DB and I am trying to limit the DB size to 1GB.
Any suggestions on how to achieve this?  Is this a bug?

NOTE: rocskdb version 3.13.0 is used for this experiment.

Thanks!
