I have been testing RocksDB (both Master and v4.1 branches) in a Fedora 23
PPC64LE environment using the stock GCC 5.1.1 compilers. During "make check" one
and only one test fails, ldb_cmd_test:

```
[bcbrock@ppc64le]$ ./ldb_cmd_test
[==========] Running 2 tests from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 2 tests from LdbCmdTest
[ RUN      ] LdbCmdTest.HexToString
util/ldb_cmd_test.cc:22: Failure
Value of: static_cast<int>(actual[i])
  Actual: 255
Expected: expected[i]
Which is: -1
[  FAILED  ] LdbCmdTest.HexToString (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] LdbCmdTest.HexToStringBadInputs
Invalid hex input 123.  Must start with 0x
Invalid hex input Ox12.  Must start with 0x
[       OK ] LdbCmdTest.HexToStringBadInputs (0 ms)
[----------] 2 tests from LdbCmdTest (1 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 2 tests from 1 test case ran. (2 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] LdbCmdTest.HexToString

 1 FAILED TEST
```

Simply exporting

```
EXTRA_CFLAGS=-fsigned-char EXTRA_CXXFLAGS=-fsigned-char
```

prior to the build solves the problem. However, given that this is the only
test that fails I wonder if the solution is actually to modify how the test
checks the result of HexToString?
