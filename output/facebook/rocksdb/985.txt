If you want to easily build Jemalloc for RocksDB purposes I have created a PR for a CMake build.

https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/pull/328

Any comments are welcome.

Be aware that there are Windows specific bugs in the latest source which will hopefully get fixed soon.

Also, the current RocksDB source performs early je_init() call under the covers but the latest Jemalloc does not seem to require it.
