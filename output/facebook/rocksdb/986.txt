Hi everyone, 

I was trying to do some benchmark testing on centos system which has 2 SSD of 800 GB.  How do I configure my SSD's so that the rockdb DB is on SSD so that I can do puts and gets from rocksdb which is on SSD.  I didn't see any SSD configuration document on rocksdb.org. Any help is appreciated.

Regards
