util/env_test.cc:214: Assertion failure id_size > 0
```

id_size value is returned 0. 

Can you pl provide more "detailed" info on how to reproduce this problem. wt platform? wt compiler?

platform  - 3.10.9-200.fc19.x86_64
compiler - gcc version 4.8.1

running `make check` on the latest master caused this error. was able to successfully compile the package.

@deepak1556, a quick question, can you successfully run `/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid` in your platform?

Try `cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid`

@liukai yup able to run it successfully. generates random uuid
