Is the column family model in rocksdb intended to be similar to the one in HBase? In Hbase every "cell" is identified by a row key, a column family name and a cell key ([HBase Documentation here](http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#conceptual.view)). Whereas in RocksDB, I can only find a way to represent a cell by the column family name, and a cell key. Multiple families do not seem to be tied together with a row key. 

Is there any way I can get the same behavior HBase provides offers with RocksDB?

Thanks!

You can get the same behaviour with RocksDB as you can get with HBase.  Suppose, you have the following schema in HBase (rowkey=r1, cfname=cf1, cellkey=k1). 
If you want the same schema in RocksDB, you would use (cfname=cf1, cellkey=r1+k1), i.e. prefix the rowkey to each and every cellkey before storing into rocksdb.

Please reopen this task if my explanation  is not clear.

Thanks, Dhruba. That helps!
