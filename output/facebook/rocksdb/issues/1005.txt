`*.h => "*.h"`

```
    for header in `find "include/rocksdb" -type f -name *.h`; do \
        install -C -m 644 $$header $(INSTALL_PATH)/$$header; \
    done
```

@bjne I am not a bash expert, however I think you are saying the problem is that the expansion of `*.h` would be done by `bash` and not `find`. I remember in the past being told that one should use `\*.h`, how does that compare to your suggestion of `"*.h"`?

That is correct, shell could be expanding unescaped *

I think either is fine, needs testing tho.
