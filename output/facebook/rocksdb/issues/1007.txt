There is an assertion check in the constructor 
WinRandomAccessFile():
 assert(!options.use_mmap_reads);

That's because this file does not memory mapping. The assertion is to prevent this file from being instantiated on accident. NewRandomAccessFile() should instantiate a different class that does memory mapping.
