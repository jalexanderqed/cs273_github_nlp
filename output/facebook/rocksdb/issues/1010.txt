- Modified the code to make it work on Visual Studio too
- Now using fast crc for the first and the last bytes of the data (STEP1)

Really sorry for the delay. It's not that we we don't want to review but it's just too hard for us. Let me try again.

Linux code looks identical to me, except removing line
-  while ((e-p) >= 16) {
  -    CRC32(&l, &p);
  -    CRC32(&l, &p);
  -  }
    I understand the logic looks the same, but the lines are there must be because of some reason. I would keep it. If you revert those lines, I can merge it.
