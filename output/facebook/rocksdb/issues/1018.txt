``` cpp
  ClipToRange(&result.write_buffer_size,
              ((size_t)64) << 10, ((size_t)64) << 30);
```

This results in trying to clamp between 65,536 and 0, resulting in clamping to 65,536, resulting in very small buffers, resulting in ShouldFlushNow() being true quite easily, resulting in assertion failing and database performance being "not what it should be".

The fix is either to do something like this

``` cpp
static const size_t clamp_max = std::conditional<sizeof(size_t) == 4,
      std::integral_constant<size_t, 0xffffffff>,
      std::integral_constant<size_t, 64ull << 30>>::type::value;

ClipToRange(&result.write_buffer_size, ((size_t)64) << 10, clamp_max);
```

Or you can use a define.

Awesome, do you need me to do the PR?
