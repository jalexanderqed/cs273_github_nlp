Hi,

I tried to implement the prefix seek in my golib, but I got it not working :(
Test to reproduce my problem (phase "prefix"): https://gist.github.com/tecbot/9833739

Maybe I'm missing something or configured wrong?
Thx!

I'm not sure that prefix seek will work with vector memtable rep. Use HashSkipList or HashLinkedList

Currently only HashSkipList and HashLinkedList support prefix seek.

Good catch, but wouldn't be better to print a error msg like "prefix seek not supported" in that case? IMHO the msg is currently confusing. 

BTT: I extended the C API to create HashSkipList or HashLinkedList, but now I get a segmentation fault in util/murmurhash.cc:37. You find the code here to reproduce the problem (run `./c_test`): https://github.com/tecbot/rocksdb/tree/c-api-prefix

I figured out that if I call `rocksdb_create_iterator` the prefix is not the same as in `rocksdb_readoptions_set_prefix`. I added a debug output that print the size of the prefix.

Thx for help!

Can you try using ReadOptions::prefix_seek = true instead of setting ReadOptions::prefix? We plan to deprecate ReadOptions::prefix in future versions of RocksDB.

I removed the ReadOptions::prefix and use now Iterator::seek and it works. Thank you!
