Fixed the error in 
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Facebook/rocksdb/build/1.0.755

Thank you @igorcanadi 
Since such issue has happened many times, I am suggesting to include these warnings/errors in Travis build. Thoughts? 

error C2220: warning treated as error - no 'object' file generated 
warning C4267: 'argument' : conversion from 'size_t' to 'uint16_t', possible loss of data 

@SherlockNoMad thank you so much for fixing it.

I agree!
