Use async file handle and wrap sync API on top of async API. This provides better parallelism on Windows.

The change is in Windows port only.

The previous commit (583157f) already has a PR open. 

So this change would be for async file handle only once that PR is merged.

Will update the branch with latest commits.

Need to look into test failures on Windows. I didn't have such local repro.
