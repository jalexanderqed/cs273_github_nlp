For the current version of RocksDb, do we have a way to backup and restore to / from S3?

You can write your own Env which operates on S3 files. You are also welcome to contribute back:)

haha @siying , i see. Thanks for the info :)

rocks-strata is a tool that can backup RocksDB and it already has an S3 implementation: https://github.com/facebookgo/rocks-strata.

@igorcanadi wow, i will definitely take a look! Thanks !
