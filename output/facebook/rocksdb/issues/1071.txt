Hi,

In our Java app we would like to pause and resume Rocks compaction from time to time (for example, in order to do our own EBS snapshot).

Are those APIs available on JNI interface? I did a quick search and could not find any.
If they are not in JNI, are they available in the original C/C++ APIs? Any plan to add them to JNI?

Or, is there any other way to achieve what we are trying to do on Java side?

Thanks,
Sam

@sam-guo If they are available in the C++ API and you can point me to the methods, I will happily add wrappers to the Java API for you.

Hi adamretter,

I did a grep and saw these 2 functions:

./db/db_impl.cc:Status DBImpl::PauseBackgroundWork()
./db/db_impl.cc:Status DBImpl::ContinueBackgroundWork()

that I think will work. Could you add them to the Java API?

Thanks!
