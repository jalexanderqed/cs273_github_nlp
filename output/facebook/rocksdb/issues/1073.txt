I fixed the wrong letters, LevelDB -> rocksDB, because I thought that LevelDB is the wrong presentation.

the following show my fix :

fprintf(stderr, "LevelDB:    version %d.%d\n",
            kMajorVersion, kMinorVersion);

----------------->
fprintf(stderr, "rocksDB:    version %d.%d\n",
            kMajorVersion, kMinorVersion);

Can you make it RocksDB (capital first letter?)

Yes, I made it RockDB  before 
thank you
