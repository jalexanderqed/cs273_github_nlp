would love to see an official rockdb binding for node.js :-)

right now our only option is leveldb

Did you try https://www.npmjs.org/package/rocksdb ?

unfortunately it's not really supported and there is no repository on github. also, go badgers!

Higher level bindings...
https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup

Lower level bindings...
https://github.com/rvagg/node-leveldown

Alternate bindings...

@hij1nx ohh very cool. unfortunately rvagg's stuff doesn't really work on 0.11.x. Do the leveldown bindings work with rocksdb though?

I believe the only issue was with `nan`, the library that provides native abstractions for node. But, I also recently heard that it works again for `0.11.x`, you might want to join us in IRC and ask around: `##leveldb` on `irc.freenode.net`.

We are likely not be officially supporting node.js bindings. We hope somebody from the node.js community might be able to provide good and supported bindings.
