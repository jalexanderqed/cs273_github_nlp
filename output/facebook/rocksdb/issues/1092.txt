Implemented:

2. `WriteBatch#rollbackToSavePoint`
3. `WriteBatchWithIndex#setSavePoint`
4. `WriteBatchWithIndex#rollbackToSavePoint`

Good stuff!  The patch looks good to me.  I only have some style-related comments.  Once they are addressed it's good to go!

@yhchiang Sorry about that, those formatting issues should be addressed now.

LGTM.  Thanks for the contribution!!
