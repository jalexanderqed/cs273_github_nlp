Test plan is to run ./sst_dump_test to verify the code of the pull request.

./sst_dump_test result **after** the code change of the pull request:

...
Compression: kNoCompression Size: 28056
Compression: kSnappyCompression Size: 7066
Compression: kZlibCompression Size: 3868
Compression: kBZip2Compression Size: 2896
Unsupported compression type: kLZ4Compression. Size is not shown.
Unsupported compression type: kLZ4HCCompression. Size is not shown.
Unsupported compression type: kXpressCompression. Size is not shown.
Unsupported compression type: kZSTDNotFinalCompression. Size is not shown.

The pull request was closed while I got the commits that my master branch of sakura90/rocksdb was behind.  I wanted to recompile and retest on the local branch that is even with facebook:master so other commits are verified not to break sst_dump_test.

Another pull request that does not fprintf "Size is not shown" is here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1116
