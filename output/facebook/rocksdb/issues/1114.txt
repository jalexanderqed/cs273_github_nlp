Hi all --

Some users are requesting rocksdb packages for RHEL-based operating systems.  I found build_tools/make_packages.sh script but was not able to find any of the build artifacts in any external repos.  So I wonder if you are interested in getting rocksdb packaged for Fedora, CentOS (EPEL), etc?

It would be good to get rocksdb packaged for Fedora, CentOS, etc? what are the steps/process to be followed?

Process is listed here:  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/New_package_process_for_existing_contributors

Hi Jeremy,  I read through the guidelines.  Since rocksdb is a pure c++ library, the rocksdb release process is mainly focussed on producing periodic, high-quality, bug-free releases of the source-code that can be consumed in various operating systems.

One way is for a volunteer to take a new rocksdb-release and then build packages for Fedora/CentOS and publish them in an open-source repository. The rocksdb github-repo can point to the location where the Fedora/CentOS packages are built/published. Does it sound acceptable to you?

Yes that's what I was thinking.  There's an existing open Red Hat bugzilla for this:  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1200612.

It has fallen silent for about a year, but we can still use that one.  I just wanted to make sure it was ok with the Facebook folks.

One thing we would probably ask is that if it's possible that Facebook review our packaging (RPM spec files) for correctness.  The existing make_packages.sh is doing some things that we would want to sort out prior to inclusion.

Yes I will be very happy to review whatever way I can (I am not a Fedora/CentOS expert). Thanks again for doing this.

@dhruba I'd like to cc you on the bugzilla we have open for this, what email address could I use?

Please use dhruba@gmail.com

Ah, crap.  Unfortunately I can't cc addresses, you'd have to create a bugzilla account. I'll just ping you here if/when that BZ shows movement.

Jeremy: I updated the cmake files to produce three rpms. Code in this branch:
https://github.com/adsharma/rocksdb/commits/cmake_451

Would be great if you could review and provide feedback. Things that need fixing:

ls *.rpm
rocksdb-4.5.1-Linux-devel.rpm  rocksdb-4.5.1-Linux-runtime.rpm  rocksdb-4.5.1-Linux-tools.rpm

The files could be named better (rocksdb-devel\* for eg). 

I am just wondering about RocksJava, should we have packages for that also?

@adsharma hey -- I see your changes are to a CMakefile.  But to package rocksdb, we will want to arrive at an RPM spec file.

The spec file would use a zip of (i.e.) git tag rocksdb-v4.5.1, compile the software according to the upstream project standards, and lay down files according to the distro-standardized locations.

(I apologize if you know all this already).

Jeremy: cmake has some rpm packaging support builtin.
https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:CPackPackageGenerators#RPM_.28Unix_Only.29

I tried to use it to the extent possible, but I'm not an expert on any of this. Hope someone more familiar with the distro standards can provide patches on top.

Yeah, rocksdb@fb.com is probably not the best contact email. @dhruba or @igorcanadi may have better suggestions.

Any progress on this?  I'm a Fedora user and a RocksDB package would be very much appreciated.  I can also help in testing the package if that is needed.

Cmake has enough glue to create a usable package, but it may not be
conforming to distro packaging standards.

Distros are most likely going to implement their own packaging.

@jeremyeder Do you need anything here to help package rocksdb into a redhat release?
