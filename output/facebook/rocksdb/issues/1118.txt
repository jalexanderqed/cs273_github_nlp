Hi ,

We want to be able to do fast prefix iteration but we are a bit confused as to how the prefix iteration feature will help us.

Our use case is the following,

1- Call DB::Open

2- Put some data (potentially, lots of data)

3- Do fast "prefix iteration" on the data put on 2-. 

Note that we don't know by the time we call 1- all the prefixes we want to do iterations with in 3-. From reading the explanation of the feature, it would seem that prefixes need to be specify in Options at the time of calling DB:Open. Even the so called "Seek API" https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Prefix-Seek-API-Changes seems to imply this. 

What we would like to be able to do is when we do some of the "Puts" is to tell RocksDB: this prefix is important, pay attention to future puts that share the same prefix so we can do fast iteration on them.

Any insight will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Ethan. 

You can create column family using prefix extractor (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/options.h#L399). By using this option, you can indicate important prefix whenever you write some puts into the specific column family.

@ijsong Thanks for the info. This is good and it will help us going forward.
