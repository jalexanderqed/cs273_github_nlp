  Conditionally retrofit thread_posix for use with std::thread
  and reuse the same logic. Posix users continue using Posix interfaces.

@siying @igorcanadi There has been a couple of checkins that keep breaking the build:
:\projects\rocksdb\utilities\backupable\backupable_db_test.cc(438): error C3861: 'NewChrootEnv': identifier not found [C:\projects\rocksdb\build\backupable_db_test.vcxproj]
c:\projects\rocksdb\utilities\backupable\backupable_db_test.cc(439): error C3861: 'NewChrootEnv': identifier not found [C:\projects\rocksdb\build\backupable_db_test.vcxproj]

@ajkr @siying e61ba052b3687de8b02e921232254e21ac2241dd refactors backupable test in a platform specific way essentially disabling this test on non-Posix platforms.

This is also broken on Windows, seems like a generic problem

Travis failures are related to the same test. Not related to this PR.

It looks good to me. Since it is an environment related change, @ajkr can you help with applying the PR to our dev servers and run our test suites? I'm in China and don't have access to our internal hosts.

Looks great! I ran it under asan/tsan/valgrind in our environment and couldn't find any issues.
