I am using rocksdb on embedded system 
Linux tegra-ubuntu 3.10.67-g458d45c #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Feb 8 17:44:18 PST 2016 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

I have received following error, is this compiler related ?

```
 nvcc --std=c++11 TeraCore.cpp 
In file included from /usr/include/rocksdb/immutable_options.h:10:0,
                 from /usr/include/rocksdb/db.h:18,
                 from TeraCore.cpp:3:
/usr/include/rocksdb/options.h:69:32: error: enumerator value -1 is too large for underlying type ‘char’
   kDisableCompressionOption = -1,
```

I think we can change the rocksdb code (in include/rocksdb/options.h)

kDisableCompressionOption = -1

to
kDisableCompressionOption = 0xff

Please verity  if this fixes your problem, and if it does, then submit a pull request for your rocksdb change. 

It seems like `0xff` does not work for compilers that define `char` to use the same representation as `signed char` [0]. Maybe also make the type `unsigned char` or `uint8_t`?

@4tXJ7f andres: your suggestion makes sense

when i run `make install`

```
*** Error in `g++': double free or corruption (top): 0x0009e030 ***
Aborted
```

leveldb works fine tough 

#1160 

Seen this same issue when try to compile ceph from GIT. Any proposed solution besides @vmorris one?
