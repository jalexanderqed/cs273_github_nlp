Summary:
cmake was previously supported only on windows.
This diff makes it possible to use cmake on linux
and adds support for building debs and rpms.

Distributions may want to package the binaries
differently to meet their standards

Test Plan:
mkdir build
cd build; cmake ..
make -j

Not sure what the checks are, but :+1: to everything else.

@swong15 - checks are for windows. I asked the maintainers of the windows port to help resolve them.

@adsharma Made some progress today. TB continued.

@yuslepukhin thanks for looking into it. Please let me know if you figure out what's wrong with windows. I suspect it has something to do with the reordering of commands in CmakeLists.txt after breaking it up by platform.

Why removing the steps for the MSBuild on Windows? Maybe it's worth be kept in a README somewhere?

On vacation. I thought I moved it to a file called win64.cmake

Sorry, missed that one.
Is there any pending work on this one?
Does the patch work for OS X?

Back from vacation.
Main pending work is fix up windows build (Need help).
Patch not tested on OS X, but might work out of the box (because I use if
UNIX) or with minimal fix up.

FWIW we'd love to see this so that ceph can use cmake for the embedded rocksdb build.

Has someone agreed to support this going forward (adsharma or the RocksDB team at FB)? Keeping it working is more work than making it work. I am a fan of as few build scripts as possible, so I am curious whether this will replace the existing build script.

I'm happy to maintain this for Linux. The diff is stuck on making these
changes in a way that doesn't break windows. I'm looking for someone to
either fix the windows build (or make changes that would make it acceptable
there).

@adsharama i posted another PR at #1358 trying to fix the build on osx and windows. let's see if it works or not.

Closing, since #1358 was merged. 

I wonder if using #if (WIN64) instead of WIN32 was causing all the problems on windows.
Either way, packaging functionality still missing from the merged PR. I might make it into a separate pull request if I find some time to work on it.
