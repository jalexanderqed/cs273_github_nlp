`getline` on `std::cin` can be very inefficient when `ldb` is loading large values, with high CPU usage in `libc _IO_(un)getc`, this is because of the performance penalty that comes from synchronizing `stdio` and `iostream` buffers.
See the reproducers and tests in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1133 .
If an `ifstream` on `/dev/stdin` is used (when available) then using `ldb` to load large values can be much more efficient.
I thought for `ldb load`, that this approach is preferable to using `<cstdio>` or `std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false)`.
I couldn't think of a use case where `ldb load` would need to support reading unbuffered input, an alternative approach would be to add support for passing `--input_file=/dev/stdin`.
I have a CLA in place, thanks.

Just to note that I think the failures from the travis-ci build jobs are unrelated to the change in this pull request.  The failures are:

```
0.17s$ curl -sSL "http://llvm.org/apt/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key" | sudo -E apt-key add -
gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found.
The command "curl -sSL "http://llvm.org/apt/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key" | sudo -E apt-key add -" failed and exited with 2 during .
```

The consule output from the appveyor build is:

```
c_test.vcxproj -> C:\projects\rocksdb\build\Debug\c_test.exe
Command exited with code 1
```

and I suspect this could also be unrelated to the change in this pull request.
Thanks.

Can you rebase to relaunch the CI test?

I created https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1207 to re-run the CI tests.  Thanks.
