Hi,

I am not able to find the api in java for prefix seek functionality in 4.5.1 version of RocksDB.
Could anyone help me in confirming about this, would really appreciate that.

In the Java API - at the moment there is only support for the following prefix extractors:
1. FixedPrefixTransform
2. CappedPrefixTransform

These are currently available on Options and ColumnFamilyOptions via . `#useFixedLengthPrefixExtractor(int)` and `#useCappedPrefixExtractor(int)` respectively.

Ohk, Thanks for the prompt reply.
