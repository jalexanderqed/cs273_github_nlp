Hey guys,

I seem to be running into some issues with the Visual Studio 12 2013. I don't exactly know which libraries to link, 
I am currently attempting to create a test database and close it in C++.

The linker errors I seem to be receiving seem to be a library-linker problem. However, I do not know if I should explicitly link it to 

rocksdblib.lib 
rocksdb.lib or testutillib.lib

Any help is appreciated!

@HawleyJean i believe this is because you are not strictly following the steps in the [CMakeList.txt](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L16) when compiling rocksdblib,which should be like, in your case:

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64" ..
```

you can find the reason [here](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/1152)

Thank you! So I have the number of tests compiling and working. However, I am interested in building my own tests in Visual Studio C++. If I want to start a new cpp class with the code indicated above what sort of steps would I need to take in order for it to run smoothly?
