when the file deletions are disabled, this interface returns value that > 0, and if the file deletions are enabled, it returns value that = 0.
I think it should be reversed.

See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/db.h#L725-L729

The return value acts as a counter for the number of threads that have disabled file deletions and not reenabled them yet. The name should probably be something like NumFileDeletionsDisabled().

Yes, it's more reasonable to change the method name.
