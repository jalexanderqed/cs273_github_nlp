Hi Adam,

I do not see these methods in any available rocksdbjni.jar.

Thanks,
Kobi

@kobikis, hmm that is very interesting. I see that it is present in master but somehow not in the 4.11.2 tag, let me ask the FB team what happened...

@kobikis Somehow this didn't make it into those releases. @yhchiang just confirmed to me that 4.13 will most likely be arriving next week, and I just checked and can confirm that that includes the changes that you are looking for.

Adam, Thanks again!
