I have not been able to use `arc` with RocksDB for months and months, and I was under the impression that the problem lay with Arcanist. Eventually I became frustrated enough with this, to look into it on a deeper level - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37808307/arcanist-error-on-fresh-install-mac-os-x/37825369#37825369

I have now realised that the issue is not with Arcanist but is actually with the RocksDB `arcanist_util` module for Arcanist, which relies on an older version of Arcanist. I have made the changes to bring the module up to date with the latest APIs for Arcanist and libphutil.

Please keep in mind that I am in no sense a PHP developer. I have just made the changes which seemed logical from reading the API. The latest version of `arc lint` now seems to work again with RocksDB... This definitely needs a second pair of eyes ;-)

Awesome!  Thanks for spotting that.  But it seems the patch doesn't work in some cases like my environment:

```
yhchiang@yhchiang-mbp1-2(0) ~/rocksdb $ arc lint
Exception
Failed to load class or interface 'ArcanistWorkflow': the class or interface 'ArcanistWorkflow' is not defined in the library map for any loaded phutil library. If this symbol was recently added or moved, your library map may be out of date. You can rebuild the map by running 'arc liberate'.

Any idea on how to detect the version of arc?

Facebook's internal version of arcanist differs very much from the public version of arcanist and I don't think there are any plans of converging them soon. I'm not sure if we'll be able to produce arcanist_util library that works with both versions.

I think the only way of fixing this is to actually have two aracnist_util libraries, but then the problem is how to switch between the two :(

Another idea is to install open source version of arcanist on RocksDB developer machines, alias it to oss_arc (for example) and then to send the diff, run `oss_arc diff` instead of `arc diff`.

Not sure if we can do some back using class_exists function:
http://php.net/manual/en/function.class-exists.php

@yhchiang I don't think so, as it's a subclassed method that has that argument; The type changed from `ArcanistBaseWorkflow` a very long time ago to [`ArcanistWorkflow`](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1168/commits/8f873d27b786804b79c5b918f3fafb02430039e4#diff-2f5e52b726c2ffa56a72e8dd3789fbb1R9).

I am not sure what you want to do on the public vs private argument. I would hope that Open Source RocksDB would use the Open Source Arcanist though ;-) Although, then again, being pragmatic I guess it depends on whether you require non-facebook employees to use Arcanist or not.

@adamretter: can you try whether it works for you?

@yhchiang Good man! That seems to have done it :-) i.e. still works for me with your changes.

Awesome!  Landed https://reviews.facebook.net/D59697.  Then I think we can close this PR.  Thanks for spotting the problem and a solution that provides insight!
