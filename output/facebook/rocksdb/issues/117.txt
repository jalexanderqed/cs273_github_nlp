Hi,

First of all, thank you for making this open source. I have just installed it on one of our servers (it runs CentOS 6.2) in order to evaluate it.

I installed all the dependencies and both the shared and static libraries build. However, I get two tests (out of 44) that fail.
- The first is signal_test, which in addition generates a coredump,
#0   ./signal_test() [0x406ab9] f0      /home/ehamilto/rocksdb/rocksdb-master/util/signal_test.cc:12
#1   /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x3ca681ed1d] ?? ??:0
#2   ./signal_test() [0x4069c9] _start  ??:0

(gdb) bt
#0  f0 () at util/signal_test.cc:12
#1  f1 () at util/signal_test.cc:16
#2  f2 () at util/signal_test.cc:20
#3  f3 () at util/signal_test.cc:24
#4  main () at util/signal_test.cc:31
- The second is  merge_test (does not generate a coredump),

db/merge_test.cc:344: failed: 10 == 0
#0   ./merge_test() [0x40b3e3] Options  /home/ehamilto/rocksdb/rocksdb-master/./include/rocksdb/options.h:772
#1   ./merge_test() [0x40eb0d] main     /home/ehamilto/rocksdb/rocksdb-master/db/merge_test.cc:464
#2   /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd) [0x3ca681ed1d] ?? ??:0
#3   ./merge_test() [0x406bcd] _start   ??:0

I am first and foremost interested in knowing whether this is expected (I got a copy of the repository this morning) and I can ignore them but I'd also appreciate if you could say what they mean.

I built from whatever was in the repository this morning.

Thank you in advance,

Ethan. 

signal test is meant to trigger a segment fault. So that is expected. But merge_test failure is not expected. I just ran merge_test on my machine, it works for me.

Thanks. 

From the failure I get, it looks like it doesn't like an Options variable. What is this test supposed to do?

include/rocksdb/options.h:772 is the constructor of Options(). It is not possible to be on the call stack of db/merge_test.cc:344. Are you sure it is copied correctly?

I downloaded it this morning as a zip file from,

Whatever it was, rocksdb seems to be running fine with the application I am testing it with ☺.

@ehamilto signal_test is expected (if you run unit tests using the command `make check` we don't actually run signal_test). merge_test is not expected.

Can you try doing `make clean; make dbg; ./merge_test`? That will give us correct line on which the test fails. (if you're running optimized code, our stack trace seems off)

Thanks!

Thanks Igor,

This is strange, in debug mode, the test passes,

With respect to the version of gcc that I used for the above,

]$ gcc --version

On Friday I was running things on a machine that had two different versions of the gcc runtime, so to isolate the problems I am now compiling, building, linking on a machine that has only the gcc compiler mentioned above.

In any case, I have integrated rocksdb with our app and things seem to work fine. What is the “merge test” actually testing?

Thanks,

Ethan.

@ehamiltohttps://github.com/ehamilto signal_test is expected (if you run unit tests using the command make check we don't actually run signal_test). merge_test is not expected.

Can you try doing; ./merge_test? That will give us correct line on which the test fails. (if you're running optimized code, our stack trace seems off)

Can you send me the exact line how you compiled merge_test?

For the one that passes (ie, debug mode),

make clean; make dbg

For the one that doesn’t ,

make release

I'm able to reproduce, thanks for the report, we'll fix this asap

fixed by https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/327102efa5f2b321b6fb9bf1480f1f7c9fe2438b

That was fast :).

One quick question. Was this an issue with the example code, build process or something that affected the core of rocksdb?

Thanks,

Ethan.

Never mind, I see that the issue was with the example code from the fix.

Thanks for getting it fixed so quickly.

Best,

Ethan.

It's because merge_test use assert in the following incorrect way:

```
assert(get(key, &value));
assert(put(key, value));
```

so it definitely never being executed in the release mode :)
