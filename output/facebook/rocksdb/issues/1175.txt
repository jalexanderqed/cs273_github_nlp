So after weeks on end of working with the RocksDB configuration to Visual Studio 12 C++ win64, I decided to build the test cases given in the msbuild and just write a test of Spatial_Database code on top of that.

I have run into a few errors in hopes of solving. In relation to "Insert(write, rocksdb::spatial::.....)". Its an access reading violation, and has gotten the better of me.

did u find the cause of the problem?

I did. It was because SpatialDB requires LZ4 compression library to be linked to its binary. I ended up downloading LZ4 from NuGet, and built a static library object to be linked to the RocksDB solition.

Thanks for the help! 

Thanks for the info @HawleyJean
