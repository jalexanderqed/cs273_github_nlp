I was reading a guide on reading SpatialDB values. 

The errors I've run into is in regards to the render class. What extension in rocksdb path does render come from?

Where Cursor is rocksdb::spatial::SpatialDBOptions::Cursor , 
where does Render reside ?

@igorcanadi : The SpatialDB blog post at http://rocksdb.org/blog/author/icanadi/ mentions that there is a Render function that is invoked. Can we make it explicit that the Render function is 'outside' of rocksdb?

Done:
