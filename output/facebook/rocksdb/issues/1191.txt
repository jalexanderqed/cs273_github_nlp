Added new statistics that our team wants to be able to track:
Tickers:

```
NUMBER_BLOCK_COMPRESSED      // number of compressions that occur
NUMBER_BLOCK_DECOMPRESSED    // number of decompressions that occur
```

Histograms:

```
BYTES_COMPRESSED             // tracks size of compressions
BYTES_DECOMPRESSED           // tracks size of decompressions
COMPRESSION_TIMES_NANOS      // tracks time spent on each compression
DECOMPRESSION_TIMES_NANOS    // tracks time spent on each decompression
```

As can be seen from the change list, adding these statistics required some modification of existing function definitions. This is probably unavoidable since a statistics pointer is necessary to update these values.

Note that `DECOMPRESSION_TIMES_NANOS` can replace `block_decompress_time` in `perf_context.h`, which is almost certainly inaccurate. This counter is only updated from `ReadBlockContents()` in `format.cc` before a call to `UncompressBlockContents()` that may or may not happen (it's inside an `if`). This is also not the only place from which `UncompressBlockContents()` is called, so `block_decompress_time` isn't tracking all decompressions. `DECOMPRESSION_TIMES_NANOS`, on the other hand, is updated directly from within `UncompressBlockContentsForCompressionType()`, guaranteeing its accuracy.
