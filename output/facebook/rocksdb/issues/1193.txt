I saw that rocksdb supports Android and iOS but I didn't find any document for building/integrating it for/into those platforms. So if I'm correct (that it indeed supports those platforms), could you guys give some time to write some document for it ? Such as:
- Common use cases for using Rocksdb on those platforms (when should use, when should not use, ...).
- How to build it for Android/iOS.
- Specific build options for those platforms.
- Good practices when wrapping/using it on those platforms.

Thank you.
