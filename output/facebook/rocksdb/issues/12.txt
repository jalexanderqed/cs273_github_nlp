I think I'm following the INSTALL correctly but still getting an error.

./include/rocksdb/statistics.h:9:10: fatal error: 'atomic' file not found

Which g++ version are you using?

I think I'll revise the installation guide for mac users. Seems updating to the latest xcode is not enough.

@wildthink, can you try the updated instructions for mac again: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md

Let me know if there is still any problem.

Not there yet :-(

@wildthink mayby you need to install a newer version of xcode.

```
$  xcode-select --version
xcode-select version 2333.
```

and the option '--install' of a xcode-select command is working for me.

if it is not the latest version of a xcode, 'xcode-select --install' should work normally. please, try to install a xcode again, It will be better to quick-fix for this problem
