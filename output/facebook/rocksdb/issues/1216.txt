LOG files should be unbuffered (writing to OS immediately), or at least should have an option to write without buffering. Otherwise full logs might not be written in case of rocksdb got crashed, which makes debugging harder.

```
diff --git a/util/env_posix.cc b/util/env_posix.cc
index 0c14c03..cf9712b 100644
--- a/util/env_posix.cc
+++ b/util/env_posix.cc

       f = fopen(fname.c_str(), "w");
+      setvbuf( f, (char *)NULL, _IONBF, 0 );
     }
     if (f == nullptr) {
       result->reset();
```

All log messages regardless of severity levels?

Keeping buffering for DEBUG logs is better. But calling write() (not fsync) ~100 times per second won't affect performance.
