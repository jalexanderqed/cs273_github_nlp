The tests run by `make check` require Bash. On Debian you'd need to run
the test as `make SHELL=/bin/bash check`. This commit makes it work on
all POSIX compatible shells (tested on Debian with `dash`).

Sorry I just saw some problem with this in our parallel tests. I'm reverting it to unblock tests for now. Sorry for the inconvenience.

This change has broken our log file generation. When make runs the final command what runs is /bin/sh -c ${test}  >&2 t/log-${test}. this does not work in either /bin/sh or bash for me. Its also not a common pattern. Typical to use >&    to redirect both stdout/stderr  or use 2>&1 

@vmx is there another way you can try? This way doesn't work well for us. On my hosts, the outputs are not piped to log files, but console.
