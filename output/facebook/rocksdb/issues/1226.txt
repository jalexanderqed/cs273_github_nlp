This commit makes the code to skip empty data blocks a bit clearer.

I have to admit that I don't understand the iterator code 100%, but I think my change makes sense and also `make check` passes locally.

What are the next steps? 

I'm closing this issue. This is really core functionality and although I find it sad, I can see the point of not changing it (even if tests pass).
