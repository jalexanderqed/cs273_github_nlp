When compiling by Clang 3.8.0 the following error was observed:

```
util/thread_posix.cc:22:5: error: use of undeclared identifier 'abort'
    abort();
```

To fix it, add include of stdlib.h to thread_posix.cc

Thanks @AlexNk for reporting, do you want to create a pull request to fix it ?

Just double-checked.
This issue relates only to 4.6 (latest release) and 4.7.
In later versions this file is not exists and project can be successfully compiled with clang.
