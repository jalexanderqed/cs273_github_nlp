Hi @siying 

We want to heavily use https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Creating-and-Ingesting-SST-files to replicate data, but we may using lots of snapshot for read when AddFile. We can use a RWLock, but we really don't want to block other reads when adding huge SST file (> 1GB). 

I think maybe you can ad a configuration to let user ignore snapshot checking, If user can guarantee that we won't access the data in SST range in a snapshot?

Thank you.

Hi @siddontang, The reason we disallow using AddFile() when snapshots are held is that AddFile() is adding data with sequence number zero (This is as if it's adding data to the past).

That mean that if you took a snapshot of the Database and then ingest a file. the data in this file will be visible in this snapshot even though AddFile() was called after the snapshot was taken.

Hi @IslamAbdelRahman 

I know it is dangerous for using snapshot when AddFile, but if we can ensure we can't access the data in SST range in the snapshot, is it safe? 

@siddontang, I think we can have an option to ignore the snapshot restriction as long as the user is aware of the consequences of skipping such restriction.

Are you interested in creating a pull request to add this feature and some unit tests for it ?

Yes, I will try it later. 

Thanks @IslamAbdelRahman  @baotiao 
I can close this issue now.
