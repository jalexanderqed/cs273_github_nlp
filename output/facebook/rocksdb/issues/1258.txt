Issue: #1248 

@ijsong Thanks for this, I will try and review this in the first part of the coming week for you.

@ijsong Generally looks good. Just a few minor items of cleanup. Can you also rebase to remove the merge conflict and please run `arc lint` and address any formatting issues from that too.

Thank you, @adamretter.  I will follow up your feedback as soon as possible.

@adamretter `arc lint --trace` throws exception like:

```

I installed arcanist by using homebrew on mac osx. Do I have any missing point?

@ijsong The Rocks team at Facebook have a customised version of Arcanist, every now and then we patch the config in `arcanist_util/` to try and ensure it works outside of Facebook. I submitted some patches that were merged recently: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1271 do you have those? If not you might like to rebase (or merge) your branch on master

Thank you for the contribution, @ijsong!  Would you mind squashing the changes into one diff?  This will make the review process easier.

@adamretter @yhchiang Thanks for your feedbacks. As you say, I will try to rebase/squash my commits.

@adamretter @yhchiang This PR has been passed CI and has no conflicts. Please review again.  

@ijsong Thanks for your contribution :-)
