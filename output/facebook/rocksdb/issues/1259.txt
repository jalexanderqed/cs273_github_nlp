In rocksdbJava API, how to pass Options argument to open function? And I tried to construction self-comparator,what should I do?

@xh931076284 `Options` is used when you open the Database without specifying any column families.

`DBOptions` is used when you open the Database with column families, in addition each column family takes a `ColumnFamilyOptions`.

I am not sure what you are asking about `Comparator` exactly, if you don't specify one, then RocksDB will do a byte-wise comparison of your keys by default.

@adamretter In our db, key can be defined by uint64, so I want to realize a comparator compared between uint64 types

@xh931076284 you can use the bytewise comparator for that
