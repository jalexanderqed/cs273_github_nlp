This PR contain the changes that to add check_snapshot in DB's AddFile function

issue: #1249 

Thanks @baotiao, Let's also add a unit test that uses this new option and make sure that when we use it, snapshots see the data that is added in the new file

Just curious to understand the requirement of skipping the snapshot check, is it because the ,snapshot, check is very heavyweight in performance? 

@dhruba, Actually the snapshot check is very lightweight. This feature is for people who want to use the AddFile API while holding snapshots (#1249) and don't mind the implications of doing that.

The implication of ingesting a file while holding a snapshot is that if you took a snapshot of the DB and then ingest a file, the data in this file will be visible in this snapshot even though AddFile() was called after the snapshot was taken (because data seqno in the file is 0).

Thanks for the description @IslamAbdelRahman 

@IslamAbdelRahman  I have rename the variable, change the comment and add the corresponding unit test

Thanks @baotiao, Looks great .. the test failures look unrelated
I have one final minor comment

Thanks @IslamAbdelRahman. the failures test show that if we holding snapshot, the Addfile will failed when we use the default skip_snapshot_check.
I have changed the comment.
