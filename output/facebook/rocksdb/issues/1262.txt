Currently c bindings only has ABI to create compaction filter with IgnoreSnapshots being false by default. And there is no way to change this value.

IgnoreSnapshots will be useful when snapshot is used very frequently and the consistent view can be ensured by the application even calling the filter on keys written before the snapshot.

@siying 

can we add a `ignore_snapshots` function pointer field like name or filter? 

@siddontang definitely. You are more than welcome to do that.

Hi @siying 
Maybe we should add an argument for rocksdb_compactionfilter_create function, but I worry about the compatibility issue, or should we use another new function? 

I think another function like `rocksdb_compactionfilter_set_ignore_snapshots(rocksdb_compactionfilter_t*, unsigned char)` may be better.
