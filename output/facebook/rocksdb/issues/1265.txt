I compiled rocksdb with O_DIRECT by modifiying in include/rocksdb/env.h
use_os_buffer = false;
use_direct_reads = true;
use_direct_writes = true;

When I run db_bench I get an "open error: Not implemented"
1. How do I fix this?
2. What is "use_os_buffer" exactly, how does it interact with use_direct_reads?
3. Can I pass these options to db_bench over the command line, somehow?

It seems as if rocksdb was trying to open /proc/sys/ files with O_DIRECT which fails.

How do I only open the main db with O_DIRECT?

Why do include/rocksdb/options.h do not support the direct flags?

@kradhakrishnan, Do you know the reason for getting such error ?

Basically you are opening a file on a filesystem that does not support direct IO like memory FS. Usually you get invalid argument.

We are in the process of exposing the direct IO capability via RocksDB options.

At this point, we have direct IO implemented at the Env level. It has been tested. I have tested the read code path for RocksDB (but not the write code path). I am working on enabling direct IO for RocksDB. If you are not in a rush, I would recommend waiting for RocksDB to expose the options.

Thanks @kradhakrishnan ! Is there an ETA for this feature? Feel free to close 

Sorry! There is no ETA as such.
