Hi,

I'd like to make use of the readonly DB implementation in the Go bindings:

https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb

but a patch requires a corresponding call in the c.h header file. Is this easily accomplished?

Yes! People maintaining Go bindings usually contribute to our C API. Here's one example of the pull request: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/108/files

Feel free to send a pull request, or ask tecbot or alberts (Go rocks maintainers) to help out.

BTW there's another Go binding: https://github.com/alberts/gorocks
They are planning to merge soon.

I believe we can close this now, right?
