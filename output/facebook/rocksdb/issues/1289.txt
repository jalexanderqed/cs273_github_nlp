Good day,

We use Go and [gorocksdb](https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb).

However, as far as I'm concerned, gorocksdb requires an exposed C function [here](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/c.h) in order to run table_options.block_cache->GetUsage();

If that is the case, can we go ahead and make this modification and send a PR here first?

Thanks.

JC

I should add that yes, we wanted to get the size of the block cache through gorocksdb, and intend to send a PR to gorocksdb once this C function is added here.

Thanks @jchiu0, will be waiting for the C API pull request

Hihi, I am not really allowed to push here.. Can I be added?

Sorry @jchiu0, I don't understand what do you mean by `not allowed to push`, Can you send a pull request ?

I thought I need to push to a remote branch before I can send a pull
request?

I don't have any permission to push this remote branch.

Am I getting something wrong here?

Thanks!
