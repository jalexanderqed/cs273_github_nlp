@yiwu-arbug @yhchiang Sorry I only just saw the request. I have just rebased it now :-)

Hello @adamretter.  Sorry for the long reviewing process!  The diff looks good to me, but the Java test on travis fails due to unrelated thing to this PR.  Would you mind rebasing again and see whether the failure can be solved?
