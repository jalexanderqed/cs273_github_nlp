Hi,

I have a application that stores small KV pair to rocksdb, the key and values are both quite small(100 - 200 bytes). Previously I'm using rocks4.2. The performance looks quite good and the memory usage is like ~4.6GB. Recently I upgraded to rocks4.8 and find the memory usage jumps to like ~12GB with the same load. Is there's any clues why the memory usage so high for 4.8? any options to reduce the memory usage there?

I'm using only two basic turnings:
- IncreaseParallelism()
- OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction()

thanks, -yuan

We changed some default options. You can try call options.OldDefaults() before calling the function and see whether your old behavior comes back.

I rethink about it. If you are using IncreaseParallelism() or/and OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction(), the option changes should be irrelevant. Can you compare the OPTIONS-xxx files generated using the new RocksDB with the old one and see what changed?

thanks @siying for the help! I did some tests and find the  _soft_pending_compaction_bytes_limit_ seems quite suspicious. Will do more tests to verify here.
