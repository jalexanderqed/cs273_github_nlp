Tnx for the contribution! Our max character per line limit is 80. Please shorten the long line. I believe you can do that by just calling `make format`.

Hi, unfortunately there's no easy way that I know of to install clang-format itself on OS X Mavericks. Do you have any tips? If not, can you run the formatting on my behalf :-)

Cheers,
Donovan.

I believe you get clang-format if you install Xcode command-line tools.

I can do it now, sure :)

Strange, it doesn't come up in may path and I have Xcode command line tools installed:

``` bash
$which clang
/usr/bin/clang
$clang --version
Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0
Thread model: posix
$ git diff -U0 HEAD^ | clang-format-diff.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/donovanhide/bin/clang-format-diff.py", line 115, in <module>

    raise child_exception

```

The error due to it not finding clang-format

Anyway, thanks for merging :-)
