CI for Windows (AppVeyor) fails since CMakeLists.txt has a line 'util/mutable_cf_options.cc' which does not exist currently.

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:307 (add_library):
  Cannot find source file:
    util/mutable_cf_options.cc
  Tried extensions .c .C .c++ .cc .cpp .cxx .m .M .mm .h .hh .h++ .hm .hpp
  .hxx .in .txx
CMake Error: CMake can not determine linker language for target: rocksdbli
```

Thank you!
