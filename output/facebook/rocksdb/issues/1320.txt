This will enable users to distinguish "out of disk space" errors from other I/O error and maybe take the appropriate action.

It mostly looks fine to me. I'll merge if tests pass.

There was a missing include.

Mac build failed. Can you fix it?

I can fix anything :-) It seems it cannot find ENOSPC despite the inclusion of `<errno.h>`. I will check tomorrow as I have no Macintosh accessible here.

Not sure the failures are related to this subcode.

Right it is not related. I'm merging it.
