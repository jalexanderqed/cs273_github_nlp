I installed Visual C++ runtime for Visual Studio 2015 from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145 but still getting **Can't find dependent libraries**

Dependency Walker show me these missing dependencies:

RocksDB is running well on Win7

@yuslepukhin any idea what dependency we are missing here?

Dependency Walker often does not correctly show those thunks. It does not mean they are missing. 
I am running 2012R2 and it works.
Try running a tool or a test executable. for better diagnostics.

@yuslepukhin are you running RocksDB Java(4.9.0) on Win 2012R2?
What tool are you referring to?

I am not running Java. And I just realized that you possibly talking about a distribution that Adam has been working on. I am not using that either.

However, the libraries you are referring to has nothing to do with Java.

I was under impression that you used Dependency Walker tool that is available to check for DLL dependencies on an arbitrary executable.

How do you get the above errors? Can you, say run db_bench in some perf scnario or any other tools that link to rocksdb to see if any of the dependencies are missing?

@kobikis dumpbin can be used to find the dependency.
