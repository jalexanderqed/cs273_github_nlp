How is your RocksDB instance life cycle managed? Is there any chance that the instance is tied up with a static variable? It's ideal if all instances are deleted in a controlled manner before static cleanup kicks in.

@ravikant86 are you still having issues with this? Please reopen this issue if yes.

may I know how this was fixed? I now have the same problem.

@hwpw can you open a separate issue for your problem? This is likely a result of either:
1) you keep using DB\* even after the destructor kicks in, or
2) you destruct RocksDB as part of static destruction. You need to delete DB\* before `int main()` finishes.
