When use java api get() function to make random access to DB, the time spent firstly is much longer than follow? 

Is this specific to the Java API, or does the same go for the C++ API?

@adamretter Just for java api. 

How much longer? Milliseconds? Or longer than a second?

First get() spend 1.7 seconds with 2.7 billion entries in db and 40 milliseconds with no data db.

What's your value of max_open_files, cache_index_and_filter_blocks setting, and compaction style?
