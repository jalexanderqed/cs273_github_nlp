We want to use different TableFactory for different level, but we can't find any approach to archive this requirement.
We tried to customize a TableFactory, TableReaderOptions has 'level' data member, so we can do it, but TableBuilderOptions has no 'level' data member, we can not do it!

Makes sense to have `level` passed to TableFactory in TableBuilderOptions. 
Are you interested in sending a pull request to pass the `level` information in TableBuilderOptions ? I will be happy to review it.
