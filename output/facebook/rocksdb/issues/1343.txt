Hello,

I need the capability to find the smallest key in the DB. Since SSTable is sorted, I expect that performing this operation should be fast. 

Is there an API for this? I am using RocksDB-JNI 4.9.0

This information is available by using DB::GetLiveFilesMetaData()
It looks to me that this API is not available in Java, but you are welcome to expose it

Open the DB, create an iterator and call SeekToFirst(). Would that work to you?

Oh, I don't know why I thought you are asking about finding the smallest key in every sst file.
@siying answer is the correct answer, please ignore mine

Thank you for the quick response! Seek to first should solve my problem, closing ticket will reopen if I see an issue.
