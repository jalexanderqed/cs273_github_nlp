RocksDB 4.9 introduced a bug which caused CockroachDB state invariant assertions to fire. Bisecting the changes from v4.8 to v4.9 led to https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/c27061dae763621bdcfb5cc0d0118f57269825b8 and, in particular, this diff:

From what I understand of this code, the above change expanded the set of log files considered during recovery. It appears that RocksDB 4.11.2 has fixed the issue, notably in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2a6d0cde722a92ac6e5229c97ebbd3009921c9d9 which changed recovery to ignore stale log files.

I'm primarily looking for confirmation that https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/c27061dae763621bdcfb5cc0d0118f57269825b8  did introduce the bug fixed by https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2a6d0cde722a92ac6e5229c97ebbd3009921c9d9 so that we can feel comfortable in upgrading to v4.11.2. I haven't yet narrowed down the precise sequence of events that caused our state invariant assertions to fire, but can do so if it would be helpful.

Did your regression tests hit the bug? If yes, can you send me a link to
the source for that test?

A regression test hit the bug, but the test is not at all simple (it sets up a 5-node cluster) and is relatively irritating to run (it needs 5 machines). With that caveat, the test is [Rebalance_3To5Small](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/develop/acceptance/allocator_test.go#L399), though I really don't think that will help. I can certainly create a smaller reproduction case and/or characterize why the change in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/c27061dae763621bdcfb5cc0d0118f57269825b8 is causing a problem for us. 

It is a657ee9 (one commit before c27061d) first introduce the bug fixed by 2a6d0cd. Not sure if c27061d is related.
