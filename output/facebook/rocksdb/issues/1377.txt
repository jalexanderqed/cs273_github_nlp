That is because VS 2013 does not support this C++11 feature.  See https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn457344.aspx.

`Visual Studio does not support defaulted move constructors or move-assignment operators as the C++11 standard mandates. For more information, see the Defaulted and Deleted functions section of Support For C++11/14/17 Features (Modern C++).`

And in `java/CMakeLists.txt`,  `org.rocksdb.RateLimiter` is missing.

@zedware I added the missing class here - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/1382

@zedware I wonder if we need to change the code, or if we should just require a more modern version of Visual Studio. @yuslepukhin Any thoughts on this?

VS 2015 should support this C++11 feature, see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support, R-value references, v3.0. But I failed to install it on my Windows 7.

The most recent versions of Rocksdb will not build with VS 13. There is not a way around it.

@yuslepukhin Okay, we should update the CMake.txt file then to make that clear.
