@siying @IslamAbdelRahman It looks likeTravis errors are not related. One is Java related and the other one is memory corruption which worries me a lot. Otherwise, I am prepared to merge it. Will wait unti this afternoon PDT

[ RUN      ] UniversalCompactionNumLevels/DBTestUniversalCompaction.UniversalCompactionTrivialMoveTest2/2
Assertion failed: (leftover >= 0), function AddRecord, file db/log_writer.cc, line 51.
