@domsj where do you get the undefine symbols error?

Sorry should've been more clear in my description.
In my ocaml binding for rocksdb I got an error while linking about these 'undefined symbols' after upgrading from rocksdb 4.3.1 to 4.11.2.
So it looks like at some point between those 2 releases the implementations for these symbols were removed, but the declarations in c.h were not removed. This PR fixes that oversight.
(If you grep for the symbols you'll only find them in c.h)

Thank you for your contribution!
