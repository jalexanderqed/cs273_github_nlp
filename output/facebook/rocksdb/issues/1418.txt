@xh931076284 If you mean with Microsoft Windows binaries, then please see the CMakeLists.txt file for instructions. The current release on Maven Central has Windows binaries available if that is easier.

@adamretter Yes, I do as the CMakeLists.txt described, and get the dll, I try to compile a jar used maven but failed.  Can you tell me to compile  a jar in windows. 
I want to do this because I add some java native methods to java API and  need to re-compile a jar in windows.

@xh931076284 Did you add `-DJNI=1` to your cmake build?

@adamretter Yes, I did.
