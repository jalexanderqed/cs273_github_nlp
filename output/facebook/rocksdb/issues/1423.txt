@avsej So I am trying to reproduce this, I am not that familiar with building on FreeBSD, I used to use FreeBSD as my operating system but that was a few years ago now.

The process I am following on FreeBSD 11 is:

```
cd /usr/ports/devel/gflags
sudo make install

cd /usr/ports/archivers/bzip2
sudo make install

cd /usr/ports/archivers/snappy
sudo make install

(Optional for RocksJava)
cd /usr/ports/java/openjdk7
sudo make install
```

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
cd rocksdb
CXX=clang++ CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/openjdk7/include -I/usr/local/openjdk7/freebsd" CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/openjdk7/include -I/usr/local/openjdk7/include/freebsd" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" gmake -j4 rocksdbjava
```

Unfortunately this gives the error:

```
gmake[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/home/aretter/rocksdb/java'
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsnappy
clang++: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
gmake: *** [Makefile:1407: rocksdbjava] Error 1
```

I am not clear why it can't find libsnappy as I have added `/usr/local/lib` to the `LDFLAGS` above  can see it is present in `/usr/local/lib`:

```
$ ls /usr/local/lib/libsnappy*
/usr/local/lib/libsnappy.a      /usr/local/lib/libsnappy.so     /usr/local/lib/libsnappy.so.1       /usr/local/lib/libsnappy.so.1.3.0
```

What am I missing?
