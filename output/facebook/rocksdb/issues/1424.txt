These are two handy options I used in my experiment. Sending this PR in hope that others might find it helpful when they also want to use direct I/O (for bypassing OS page cache or other purposes).

You need to actually set these options in `InitializeOptionsFromFlags()`.

Seems that I didn't push the correct version of my code. Fixing it.

Updated. Also fixed mmap_read and mmap_write initialization in db_bench.

The directIO read should be working. RocksDB is not ready for directIO write yet.

@siying That's exactly what we observed last week. Do you think it better to remove the use_direct_writes, or leave it as a future option?

@omegaga, Yes let's remove `use_direct_writes` to not confuse users, and add it later when we support it

@omegaga, can you please look at the test failures ?

Fixed. Seems that current failed test is unrelated.

LGTM. Will merge after sandcastle job finishes.

@IslamAbdelRahman do we have land bot yet, or shall I stick to github merge?
