A bug that tailingIterator->Seek(target) skips records.

I think the bug is in the SeekInternal starting at lines 387:
search_left_bound > search_right_bound
There are only 2 cases this can happen:
(1) target key is smaller than left most file
(2) target key is larger than right most file

The comment is wrong, there is another possibility that at the higher level there is a big gap such that the file in the lower level fits completely in the gap and then 
indexer->GetNextLevelIndex returns search_left_bound > search_right_bound I think pointing on the files after and before the gap.

fixed this bug with test case added.
