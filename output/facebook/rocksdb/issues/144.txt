Hi,

It would be great to have a binary distribution available, that would include multi-platform builds (linux, macosx) and bindings (java, etc).

Earlier, I have made an attempt on an automated build VM environment setup using Vagrant / Ansible: https://github.com/phraktle/rocksdb-build â€“ this might serve as useful starting point, but I don't have time to maintain this.

Thanks,
  Viktor

Hi Viktor.  Yes, in the long run, we will try to produce a nicer  final artifact (esp. for the Java binding.)  Thanks for the useful feedback and information!  

This is coming soon :) https://reviews.facebook.net/D24141
