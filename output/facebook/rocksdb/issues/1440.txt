FreeBSD 11.0 with cmake clang 3.8.0

```
/home/anan/projects/rocksdb/util/env_test.cc:1067:22: error: use of undeclared identifier 'O_DIRECT'
```

Did you mean `cmake`? Have you tried `gmake`? Can you tell me the full command line you are running?

%cmake ../../rocksdb/
%make

gmake has the same error.

maybe should use O_SYNC on Freebsd?

This is a compile time error
