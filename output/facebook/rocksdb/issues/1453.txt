@tudor We are getting the following error in our contbuild. Do you mind fixing it? Thanks. https://gist.github.com/yiwu-arbug/aca8bc19c11316d73990d70076a168a4

@yiwu-arbug By "our" contbuild, I'm assuming you mean Facebook's? I'm no longer a Facebook employee. Can you check whether the contbuild sets the JEMALLOC_INCLUDE environment variable explicitly? (I removed that from build_detect_platform, I can add it back if that's the reason.)

Ah, you do mean Facebook's contbuild, and it does set it.

`build_tools/fbcode_config.sh:JEMALLOC_INCLUDE=" -I $JEMALLOC_BASE/include/"`

@yiwu-arbug Try now?

@tudor Thanks. Let's wait for the build.
