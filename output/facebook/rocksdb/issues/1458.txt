Opening existing RocksDB attempts recovery from log files, which uses
wrong sequence number to create the memtable. This is a regression
introduced in change a400336.

This change includes a test demonstrating the problem, without the fix
the test fails with "Operation failed. Try again.: Transaction could not
check for conflicts for operation at SequenceNumber 1 as the MemTable
only contains changes newer than SequenceNumber 2.  Increasing the value
of the max_write_buffer_number_to_maintain option could reduce the
frequency of this error"

This change is a joint effort by Peter 'Stig' Edwards @thatsafunnyname
and me.

@reidHoruff the PR looks good, but can you explain a little bit what cause the bug? I'm not familiar with how transaction db handle sequence id.

It's an off-by-one error. After recovery when the first memtable is created a sequence id 1 too large was used to create the memtable table. This sequence id is used for pessimistic transactions to determine if there is a conflict since start of transaction. Because of the OBO error the sequence id of the first insert into this memtable was smaller than the sequence id of the table so the transaction layer incorrectly thought it could not do conflict checking.

LGTM. Landing.
