The architecture document (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-Architecture-Guide) mentions that "There is no limit to the size of a key or a value."

However when trying to run db_bench (release 2.8), I get the following error:
$<code>./db_bench --benchmarks=fillrandom  --statistics=1 --histogram=1 --db=./testDB --key_size=256 --num=3000000 --numdistinct=3000000 --readwritepercent=10 --value_size=256</code>
$<code>Invalid value for --key_size: 256, must be < 128 ERROR: failed validation of new value '256' for flag 'key_size' </code>

Is there a way to increase the key size to 256 _bytes_?

It is a benchmark program's limitation, not RocksDB's. Actually the benchmark has been modified so even this check might not be needed. You can try to raise kMaxKeySize in db/db_bench.cc and see whether it can just work.

Thanks @siying just raising the limit works! I have another question related to db_bench. 
I am not sure what the histogram output represents. Example, how should one interpret the following:
$<code>./db_bench --benchmarks=fillrandom  --statistics=1 --histogram=1 --db=./testDB --key_size=256 --num=300000 --numdistinct=300000 --readwritepercent=10 --value_size=512</code>

Output:
[       5,       6 )      163   0.054%   0.054%
[       6,       7 )    18423   6.141%   6.195% #
[       7,       8 )    76395  25.465%  31.660% #####
[       8,       9 )    62437  20.812%  52.473% ####
[       9,      10 )    25550   8.517%  60.989% ##
[      10,      12 )    23375   7.792%  68.781% ##
... and so on.

First column is the interval, let's say [9, 10). Next column is number of samples that fall in this interval. Third column represent percentage of samples in that interval. Fourth column is the cumulative percentage of samples up to this interval (meaning all samples less than 10 in this case). The last column is just a graphical representation of the second column.

Does that answer your question?

Yes, thank you!
