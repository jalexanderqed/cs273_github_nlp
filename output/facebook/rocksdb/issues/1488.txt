Will merge after build success.

It's weird that the `db_block_cache_test` passed on my machine

where do you see `db_block_cache_test` is failing?

The `Some checks were not successful` information stated below

If you scroll to the bottom of https://travis-ci.org/facebook/rocksdb/jobs/175212806 it shows "No space left on device". Something wrong with Travis and not related to your change.

We also need to keep an eye on the sandcastle build here: https://phabricator.intern.facebook.com/D4157784
But the job seems to be queueing for a long time.

cc @siying not sure if you'll have any comment on the change.
