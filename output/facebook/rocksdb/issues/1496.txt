Fixed the unit tests after the rebase.

Looks like we need to rebase again, I have another minor comment, why do we need to disable it for `PresetCompressionDict`

Since I dont have any more comments, I will approve, Can you please rebase so we can land ?

The test failures seem to be unrelated. I ran them on my host and they all pass. I'll just merge after resolving the conflict.

I simply rebased it. The only conflict is in HISTORY.md. I ran simple unit locally and it passed. I'm going to land it.
