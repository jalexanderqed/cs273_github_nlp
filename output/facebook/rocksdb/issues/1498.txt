The page size util/env_test.c:NewAligned is a fixed 4K size rather than using sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) to determine this like the rockdb does.

This results in an assertion during make check on non-4K page size Linux kernels.
Is passing this test in your platform important for you?

yes. I'll get a patch written and submitted.

note to self: and util/io_posix.cc:NewAligned
