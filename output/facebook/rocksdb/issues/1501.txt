Adjusted AddToBuilder() to take lower_bound and upper_bound, which serve two purposes: (1) only range deletions overlapping with the interval [lower_bound, upper_bound) will be added to the output file, and (2) the output file's boundaries will not be extended before lower_bound or after upper_bound. Our computation of lower_bound/upper_bound consider both subcompaction boundaries and previous/next files within the subcompaction.

Test cases are here (level subcompactions: https://gist.github.com/ajkr/63c7eae3e9667c5ebdc0a7efb74ac332, and universal subcompactions: https://gist.github.com/ajkr/5a62af77c4ebe4052a1955c496d51fdb) but can't be included in this diff as they depend on committing the API first. They fail before this change and pass after.

Good work!  LGTM.  Only some mior comments on the Phabricator.  Should be good to go!

And don't forget to also commit the tests once the API PR is landed :)
