Summary:
LZ4 1.7.3 emits warnings when calling the deprecated function `LZ4_compress_limitedOutput_continue()`.  Starting in r129, LZ4 introduces `LZ4_compress_fast_continue()` as a replacement, and the two functions calls are [exactly equivalent](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/lib/lz4.c#L1408).

Test Plan:
`make all` with LZ4-1.7.3.
`make all` with LZ4-r127 failed on a lua test, but the the compression built.
Continuous build.
