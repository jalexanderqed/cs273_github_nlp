I encountered an error: "File is too large for PlainTableReader!" when using universal compaction and table factory is PlainTableFactory, and target_file_size_mulitplier is 2, and level_num is 7.
Why PlainTableBuilder can build a table which can not be read?
How many compaction threads do you use?

@siying  base_background_compactions = 2;
         and max_background_compactions = 4;
