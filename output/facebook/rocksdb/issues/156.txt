Thanks for fixing this! I have a style comment :)

Hi Igor,
Is the function `PrintThreadInfo` at the right place in the commit 96428a769ea908a2f3b17a8c881a10bb72328a4f ?
Waiting for your review.

No, it's in the global namespace now. Put it on the line 95 please.

Sorry, I am making it right.

Thanks a lot!
