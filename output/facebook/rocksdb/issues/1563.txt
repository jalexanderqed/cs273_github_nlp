I want to use rocksdb in java application on x86 windows pc. is it possible or it will require too much changes?
There are released artifacts for Windows on Maven. At the moment we only support 64bit windows, and you can build from that, see CMakeLists.txt.

If you want 32bit support, you would need to work on that, we have in general 32bit support including a Linux 32 bit build, but at the moment it is not supported for Windows.
