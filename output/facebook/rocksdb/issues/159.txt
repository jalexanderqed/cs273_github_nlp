Some wiki pages are missing:

```
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-Table-Format
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-Architecture-Guide
```

Did you moved it or merge into other pages?

Thanks

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-BlockBasedTable-Format
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/PlainTable-Format

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Basics

Thanks a lot.
A lot of links from github/facebook/rocksdb or rocksdb.org(i.e. http://rocksdb.org/blog/521/lock/) are pointed to 'Rocksdb-Architecture-Guide'.
Maybe it's better to create a link in the page 'https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Rocksdb-Table-Format'

That's a good idea. I added the link to the new page on the old pages. Thanks!
