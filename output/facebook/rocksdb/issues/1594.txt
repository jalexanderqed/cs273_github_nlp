When enabled, this option replaces range tombstones with a sequence of
point tombstones covering the same range. This can be used to A/B test perf of
range tombstones vs sequential point tombstones, and help us find the cross-over
point, i.e., the size of the range above which range tombstones outperform point
tombstones.

Test Plan: ran it, verified the regular tombstones are added as expected
