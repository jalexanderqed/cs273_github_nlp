Hi team rocksDB, 
   I am getting authentication approval  issues while browsing code for review 
ref link: https://reviews.facebook.net/18717 . Is this link internal to FB ? Phabricator authentication waiting for approval. Can some help me to resolve this issue ?

This is not internal to Facebook. Maybe you need to verify your e-mail?

I am directly able to login to my Phabricator account. But with ref to link  https://reviews.facebook.net/18717 i am getting this issue Waiting for approval (Wait Patiently)

Your URL is incorrect. Please use https://reviews.facebook.net/D18717 instead of https://reviews.facebook.net/18717

Just in case you didn't notice, It misses a 'D' before 18717 in your link. Maybe it just a typo when posting.

sorry for typo. I tried opening the link https://reviews.facebook.net/18717  but same issue. Even  created another account and completed the email verification with new account. I am able to login to my phabricator account. I can see verified account in queries window. But with link   https://reviews.facebook.net/18717  I am getting info log  "Your account has been created, but needs to be approved by an administrator. You'll receive an email once your account is approved."   

You're still missing D in the link

please reopen this issue if it is not yet solved....
