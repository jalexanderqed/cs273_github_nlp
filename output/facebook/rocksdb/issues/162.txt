Hi,

Can anyone please comment what are the recommended versions for following:
1. **GCC** - Install.md mentioned that atleast GCC 4.7 is required. Is any GCC version > 4.7 fine?
2. **zlib**
3. **bzip2**
4. **snappy**
5. **gflags**

Thanks.!

1. any >= 4.7 should be fine. We develop on 4.8.1
2. probably doesn't matter. We develop with 1.2.5
3. probably doesn't matter. We develop with 1.0.6
4. probably doesn't matter. We develop with 1.0.3
5. We had some issues with newer versions, but that should be fixed now. We develop with 1.6

Thanks a lot @igorcanadi
