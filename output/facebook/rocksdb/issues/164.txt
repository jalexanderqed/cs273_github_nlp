Hi,

I got an error message

org.rocksdb.RocksDBException: IO error: /Volumes/Backup/pbf/planet-140514/nodes/021806.log: Too many open files
    at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.put(Native Method)
    at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.put(RocksDB.java:139)

Does the max open files have any limits ?

I open rocksdb with following options:

options = new Options();
options.setCreateIfMissing(true);
options.setMaxOpenFiles(-1);
options.setAllowMmapReads(false);
options.setAllowMmapWrites(false);
options.setMaxWriteBufferNumber(4);

When error occurs, the db folder contains about 9620 sst files and folder size is about 19GB.
The version of RocksDB is 3.0.

Does any one have any suggestion?

Thanks.

After I searched the keywords "Too many open files" in source files, I don't find any things.
I found this exception should throw by OS X system.

Some information links:
http://superuser.com/questions/433746/is-there-a-fix-for-the-too-many-open-files-in-system-error-on-os-x-10-7-1
And many leveled users encounter same issue, I list two links only:
https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-server/issues/55
https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/issues/detail?id=175

To change the system setting seems not the best way to solve this problem.
Do you have any suggestions to force to db to close opened files ?

Thanks.

Can I know what is the output when you run `ulimit -a` on your OS X command line?  In case it shows a low maximum open files, you can change it by `ulimit -n <your_max_open_files>`.  For instance, `ulimit -n 2048` allows you to open 2048 files at a time.

Hi yhchiang

The output is 

core file size          (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) unlimited
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited
open files                      (-n) 256
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 1
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited
max user processes              (-u) 709
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited

The default number of max opened files is 256, it seems too be small, I will try use large setting.
Very thanks for your suggestion.

Another my question is when the program run a long time, and there are many new data put into db, the number of un-closed files will increase or it will be in some range?

@yuchi518 check out options.max_open_files. However, your DB seems to have a lot of files. You might want to increase the files sizes. Check out this function, might be useful: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/options.h#L109

Hi @igorcanadi 

OK
I will try to study that function.

Thanks

@yuchi518  when u use this `ulimit -n <your_max_open_files>` , this is only implemented in current shell, pls pay attention it. Or u can change them forever, go to /etc/security/limits.conf  , add 
`*                -       nofile          65536`, then reboot you can see it always be changed

@AaronCsy 

Very thanks your suggestion.

I changed them in /etc/sysctl.conf file with following setting
kern.maxfiles=20480 
kern.maxfilesperproc=18000

But adding more data, these value should be updated again, doesn't it?

@yuchi518 
Yeah, I think so.

Closing this issue, but feel free to reopen it if it's not resolved.

hi @yuchi518 did you slove this problem?i across this problem now,it occured when i insert many new data ,i set the ulimit ,but i think if i insert more than current data,it will be occured. 

Hi @haochun,

Yes, it should always occurs when more data are inserted.
Sometimes I think rocksdb is not suitable for big data, not like other
NoSQL db.

@haochun  @yuchi518  no you can set that setting also to unlimited in addition you can control how many handles are open using options.
