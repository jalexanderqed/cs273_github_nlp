I have completed the CLA.

Tnx for the contribution! Can you please:
1) run `make format`? I think some lines are over 80 chars
2) run `make c_test; valgrind --leak-check=full ./c_test`

I have run `make format` and added a line to destroy `cfilter` as suggested.

valgrind detected no problems with c_test.

Thanks!
