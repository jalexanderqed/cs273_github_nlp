Hi,
I've encountered two cases "make check" compilation failed.  I suppose It may be useful for others to share this information (I hope...).
1. "make static_lib" before "make check"
   If you follow INSTALL.md precisely, you could do "make static_lib" first. Then "make check".
   The object files created by "make static_lib" are missing some debug facilities since -DNDEBUG is defined by Makefile, which causes in turn a failure during "make check" compilation.
   It would be nicer to add a line to INSTALL.md.  "make check cannot run after make static_lib/shared_lib, because make check requires some debug facility (hence compiling without NDEBUG).  make clean first.  Then make check"
2. Non standard library path for gflags
   When "make check" requires gflags to be linked in.  So I changed Makefile as the below.

``` diff
$ git diff Makefile
diff --git a/Makefile b/Makefile
index c148aee..92364ba 100644
--- a/Makefile
+++ b/Makefile

 endif

 WARNING_FLAGS = -Wall -Werror
-CFLAGS += $(WARNING_FLAGS) -I. -I./include $(PLATFORM_CCFLAGS) $(OPT)
-CXXFLAGS += $(WARNING_FLAGS) -I. -I./include $(PLATFORM_CXXFLAGS) $(OPT) -Woverloaded-virtual
+CFLAGS += $(WARNING_FLAGS) -I. -I./include -I$(HOME)/local/include $(PLATFORM_CCFLAGS) $(OPT)
+CXXFLAGS += $(WARNING_FLAGS) -I. -I./include -I$(HOME)/local/include $(PLATFORM_CXXFLAGS) $(OPT) -Woverloaded-virtual

-LDFLAGS += $(PLATFORM_LDFLAGS)
+LDFLAGS += $(PLATFORM_LDFLAGS) -L$(HOME)/local/lib -lgflags

 LIBOBJECTS = $(SOURCES:.cc=.o)
 LIBOBJECTS += $(SOURCESCPP:.cpp=.o)
```

The following environment variable is also needed before "make check", as everybody can guess.
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/local/lib

My environment
- CentOS 6.5 Basic Server Installation
- Devtoolset-2 (gcc 4.8.2 20140120)
- zlib-devel, bzip2-devel, snappy-devel are installed using yum
- The latest version of gflags taken from github is compiled and installed to ~/local/ using Cmake 3.0.0

Thanks for your suggestion, here's the patch that updates INSTALL.md (https://reviews.facebook.net/D28071) and should be ready soon in the master.
