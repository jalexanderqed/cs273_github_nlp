When I use db_bench tool to benchmark the rocksdb v3.1

I configured the benchmark as readrandom, firsty load the data and then do readrandrom. 

And I found the read operations read almost data from memory but not through the SSD, the read data always 0 from command 'iostat'.

Do you think this is strange? How can I make it read data through the SSD?

I am not sure what you mean by loading the data first. If "load the data"
means that all data is read into the OS filesystem cache and the database
is smaller than RAM, then it is likely that the next tests don't require
disk IO.

Actually I load the data size more than the cache and the data is located on disk as sst file.

But when I read these data , the situation happened

If load means to insert data into a RocksDB instance. If data size is
larger than the RocksDB cache but data size is less than RAM, then data can
still be cached by the OS filesystem in RAM after the load. That would
prevent disk reads.  This shows how to uncache data in that case --

@mdcallag 

My RAM is about 65 GB and the data set is about 115 GB

That's weird. Can you send us db_bench command line?
