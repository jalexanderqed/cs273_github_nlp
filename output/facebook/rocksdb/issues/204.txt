rocksdb supports prefix_extractor, namely supports range queries, but there is no get_range() like interface for us to call? so, how do I perform range scan? using Get()?

You can do it through iterators. Create a iterator by using DB::NewIterator(), Seek to the smaller boundary of your range, keep doing next() and read key() until either you reach the larger boundary of your range or Valid() becomes false.

Does any way to get the count of total data? Or, is it possible?

@yuchi518 RocksDB doesn't know number of all live keys. But we recently add a feature to estimate total number of keys: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/f6784766db165188613f581afd40ba8fb90aa2cd if you just want an estimation.
