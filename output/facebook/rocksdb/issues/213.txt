Hey guys,
                 I compiled RocksDb without snappy and tried using it from java. When I set the compression type of snappy (I was expecting an error), the put and get options still seem to work without any issues. 

``` java
val options = new Options();
   options.setCompressionType(CompressionType.SNAPPY_COMPRESSION).setCreateIfMissing(true);
var db = RocksDB.open(options, "testdbpath");
```

Is the compression type silently ignored ? 

I think we ignore it when compile time. In run time it is always appreciated. 

In that case, I think this might be a bug.

There is no snappy in the shared library depedencies, but the runtime doesn't seem to indicate anything when SNAPPY_COMPRESSION is requested (No exceptions/warnings).

@naveenatceg do you have snappy library when you build? You can take a look at build_tools/build_detect_platform and see how we decide whether to enable Snappy flag. Perhaps the library is just disabled if you don't have it when building.

That's exactly what happens (and what I want), it's not included in the build (I don't have snappy installed). My question is, why am not seeing any errors when I am requesting a compression algorithm that is not supported (with the current build) ? 
I am trying to test a situation where snappy is not installed in the machine, but the user requests it. Thanks for the prompt response!

@naveenatceg we fall back to no compression if -DSnappy is not specified.

OK, thanks! It would be useful if it can print a warning when the database is opened.
