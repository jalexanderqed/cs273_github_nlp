I check latest source and compile, and error below:

```
table/cuckoo_table_builder.cc:329:34: error: comparison of unsigned expression >= 0 is always true
      [-Werror,-Wtautological-compare]
    while (bucket_to_replace_pos >= 0) {
```

Build Env:
gcc4.9
mac OSX 10.9.3

Very sorry that when I use brew install gcc4.9, I still use gcc4.2 to compile it.

Ignore this issue.
