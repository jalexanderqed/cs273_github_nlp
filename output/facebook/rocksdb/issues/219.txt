Hi:

I have tried to compile rocksdb 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 by running "make  all". The compilation failed. Here is the error messages from compiling rocksdb 3.2

Please let me know what can be done to get around of this error.

Thanks,

David

I forget to mention that my OS is rhel6.5 with ppc64 architecture.

Yup, we shouldn't use port::MemoryBarrier anywhere else except `port/atomic_pointer.h`

table/table_reader_bench is just a benchmark, you don't really need to compile it. Just remove the rule for compiling table_reader_bench in Makefile and it should work.

Long-term, we'll fix this issue. :)

Igorcanadi:

Thank you very much your help. The compilation has passed after I commented out the table_reader_bench rule in Makefile. Now I have a different issue: make check failed when running db_test:
