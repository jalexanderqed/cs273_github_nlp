Previously, the prefix extractor was being supplied with the RocksDB
key instead of a parsed user key. This makes correct interpretation
by calling application fragile or impossible.

This is a good patch. Prefix extractor is usually given the user key, not the RocksDB internal key.

We just need some time to figure out if it's going to break some use cases.

Can you please update HISTORY.md to reflect this backwards incompatible change?

Also, please run `make valgrind_check`

Thanks for contributing!

Confirmed that this shouldn't break anything internally. Merging.

Cool thanks Igor.

It looks like this change broke the valgrind test. I'm looking into this.

Hmm I did run valgrind check. Though I did so on Darwin...
