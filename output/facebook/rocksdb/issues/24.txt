hi, I just compiled the latest sources on my local mac os x (mavericks).
in compiling, there is a single compilation errors like this. 

```
util/env_posix.cc:1401:71: error: missing binary operator before token "("
```

my compiler is same with the recommended version.

```
[junyoung@junyoung-2:/opt/rocksdb]$ g++ --version

and os information is here

```

to fix the problem I mentioned. we need to apply the following patch to the trunk.

```

Hi @junyoungkim, tnx for the reported issue. Regarding your pull request, in the second line there should be no define() around __GLIBC_PREREQ.

We have fixed the issue with this commit: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/45a2f2d8d30103f74b20ae19cd61be1f775c5ddb -- which is basically your commit, without define() in the second line.

Let me know if this fixed your problem.

Oops :0 thanks for your quick fix.
