This replaces a mishmash of pointers in the Block and BlockContents classes with
std::unique_ptr. It also changes the semantics of BlockContents to be limited to
use as a constructor parameter for Block objects, as it owns any block buffers
handed to it.

I'm really excited about the code cleanup from this patch. It will make things easier to debug. Thanks for your contributions @tdfischer !

Closing due to a new branch that goes further than this and also closes memory leaks.
