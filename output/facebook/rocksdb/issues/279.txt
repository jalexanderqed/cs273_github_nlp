Is there someone working to add support for Column Families in the java bindings?
Or I should do it myself?

I don't think we are working on it. We would really appreciate your contribution. :)

Ok, I can give it a try.
I see the current version from github doesn't even compile: there are some obvious copy&paste errors in /java/rocksjni/write_batch.cc
Maybe a forgotten commit?

Isn't there a system that at least checks that the build is not broken?

Sorry for my late reply.

Yes, as @igorcanadi mentioned, we currently have no resource on adding Java support for Column Families, but we will do our best on supporting external contributions.

We've included Java in our daily build check, and the latest build should fix the java compilation issue (but please feel free to let me know if it's not the case.) 

Only as short note. I am currently working on the Java API extension for column families. It is just not finished enough to file a pull request. 

State can be seen here: https://github.com/fyrz/rocksdb/tree/column_families_java

@yhchiang as most of column families is in now this one can be probably closed. The rest will come in the next two weeks.
