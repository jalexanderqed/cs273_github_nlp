As we know long time ago, `-Wsign-compare` is enabled for clang by default. 

Is there any other good idea for dealing with this issue 
other than patching manually from time to time?

PS
the result of `make check -j8` with brand-new clang 
(version 600.0.51 which is shipped with Xcode 6.0 GM) under macosx 10.9.4 :

```
Ran 10 tests in 3.964s

OK
```

Thanks @Chilledheart . Maybe we could run -Wno-sign-compare, at least when running tests

Thanks for merge!
