sh gets tripped up on the deprecated -a flag. Changing it locally to -e worked for me.

``` bash
if [ -a librocksdb.a ]; then \
  rm -rf /usr/local/lib/librocksdb.a; \
fi
/bin/sh: 1: [: -a: unexpected operator
```

This should be fixed now. Please reopen if it still doesn't work.

Confirmed. Thanks!
