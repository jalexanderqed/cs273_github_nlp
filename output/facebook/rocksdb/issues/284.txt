Hi,

Seeing this error during make:

In file included from db/write_controller.cc:6:0:
./db/write_controller.h:65:3: error: looser throw specifier for 'virtual rocksdb::StopWriteToken::~StopWriteToken()'
./db/write_controller.h:50:11: error:   overriding 'virtual rocksdb::WriteControllerToken::~WriteControllerToken() noexcept (true)'
./db/write_controller.h:72:3: error: looser throw specifier for 'virtual rocksdb::DelayWriteToken::~DelayWriteToken()'
./db/write_controller.h:50:11: error:   overriding 'virtual rocksdb::WriteControllerToken::~WriteControllerToken() noexcept (true)'

Verified it on Mac OSX and Linux. Can someone please take a look if some recent commit has broken the build?

I can't reproduce, but hopefully got it fixed with https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/04ce1b25f3d7623c62cd5771cd8391d02da7e31a. Can you please confirm?

Thanks! Commit fixed the issue but now got one more build error:

Hmm. Which compiler do you use? I don't understand why my compiler doesn't catch this.

@ankgup87 does it work now? 

Apologies for replaying late. It works now. Thanks a ton! :+1:
