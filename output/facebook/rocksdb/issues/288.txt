Java needs a pom and for this to be in public maven repo.
Example how to do this is at: https://github.com/fusesource/rocksdbjni/blob/master/pom.xml

Yes, we do need a pom for RocksDB Java, but we are currently short in resource on the Java part.  It would be great if someone can contribute on this.

Closing this issue as RocksJava can now be published in maven: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/308
