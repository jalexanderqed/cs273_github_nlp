I was trying to use rocksdb as a shared lib and keep getting some unresolved symbols related to bz2.

As a solution, I changed the relevant Makefile section, and put LDFLAGS after the object files, and the problem gone. BTW, there was a similar fix in leveldb, too:

https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/source/detail?r=40768657bc8ec3ded60712eeeab7c25b1b07deca

And leveldb is building shared lib at default target, so I added that too.

Tnx @sepeth .

Since at Facebook we don't use shared library, can you please remove it from the default target? Also, have you signed CLA? Please see our CONTRIBUTING.md file.

Updated pull request and signed the CLA.
