Added support for the merge operation to RocksJava.
You can specify a merge function to be used on the current database.
The merge function can either be one of the functions defined in
utilities/merge_operators.h, which can be specified through its
corresponding name, or a user-created function that needs to be
encapsulated in a JNI object in order to be used. Examples are
provided for both use cases.

This is great! Thanks for your contribution.  Before we start reviewing the detail, would you mind submitting the patch for review using https://reviews.facebook.net using `arc diff` command?  This will make the reviewing process much easier esp. for big pull request.  For example, pull request #232 by @ankgup87  (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/232) is reviewed in this diff (https://reviews.facebook.net/D21753).

@vladb38 Can you please upload this diff to reviews.facebook.net as commented by @yhchiang earlier in the comment. Its easier to discuss diffs on reviews.facebook.net

I had some issues with the review software, I will try again today.

https://reviews.facebook.net/D24525

I fixed some of the issues from the initial pull request and produced a new review:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D24573

@vladb38, thanks for your contribution once again.  It seems like D24573 includes only the update, which makes it harder to do the review.  Can I know which command you used to create the second link?  Typically I run `git commit --amend` then `arc diff`, and this will update its existing diff review. 

I see. My command was a new git commit, followed by an arc diff. I did not realize that a new commit will mean a brand new review. Should I squash the new commit into the old one and then run arc diff?

@vladb38 you can do also a `arc diff --update <rev> origin/master` from the branch

@vladb38 do you still work on this pull request ? If not I would care about getting merge functionality in.

https://reviews.facebook.net/D24525 contains my final code. I am not sure what the status of the review is or whether I need to rebase based on master in order to make that code mergeable. Perhaps the Facebook developers can let me know? I can look at it on Monday if anything else needs to be changed.

@vladb38 I only ask because it is not mergeable at the moment and there are still open points on phabricator.

I fixed the merge conflict. Can you take a look at whether this can be now merged? I tried to address the open points in phabricator.

ping @vladb38.  Have some comments in https://reviews.facebook.net/D24525 previously, once the comments are addressed, this diff should be good to go :)

@yhchiang I put some replies to the three last comments in Phabricator (for the last version). Are you referring to those three comments or some previous ones?

@vladb38: Didn't see the comment you mentioned in https://reviews.facebook.net/D24525.   Did you hit the submit button at the end to submit your replies?  Or did I follow the wrong diff?

@yhchiang I had not clicked submit. I am sorry, the review system is a bit confusing at times, I did not expect the submit step for commenting.

@vladb38 : yep, it's a bit confusing and happened to me previously.  Thanks for your contribution, btw.  Great work!
