Hi,
When I do serialisation and Deserialization of Map of type Map<String, String[]> or Map<Object1, Object2[]> then said process is done successFully but json created does not contain values for array, instead its an Object reference Id (as Ljava.lang.String;@1b77f8).
I will be greatfull for any solution.
thank you.

Hello, I am afraid that I didn't get your question.  Can you explain your question in more detail and which part is RocksDB related?  Are you talking about the Json API of RocksDB?

I'm closing this due to inactivity. @soneejaiswal feel free to reopen with more information if you still need help.
