Hi, I find there is no option for specifying the column family (eg: by name), then how can I access data in non-default column-family by ldb?

Hey @zoglee. We just recently added support to column families in RocksDB and we unfortunately hadn't had the chance to add the support to ldb yet. :( We would welcome any contributions towards making this happen
