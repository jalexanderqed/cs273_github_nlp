Hey @saghmrossi, can you try submitting this as a diff through review.facebook.net? It should be as easy as running `arc diff` once you install phabricator utils (http://phabricator.org/)

What should I put as "test plan", "reviewers", and "subscribers"?

test plan -- how you verified that your change works. You probably compiled it, added some unit tests, checked if get and put works...?

reviewers: put 'igor', that me

subscribers: leveldb

I'm getting the following error after saving the revision message:

PHP Fatal error:  Call to undefined method
FacebookFbcodeLintEngine::getPEP8WithTextOptions()
in rocksdb/linters/lint_engine/FacebookFbcodeLintEngine.php on line 39

I checked the code, and that method doesn't seem to exist in the class,
although I can't find its superclass defined anywhere after grepping the
rocksdb repo, so I'm not sure if this is a config error on my end or an
error in the code.

@saghmrossi see: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/238 that helped me.

I just tried running the patch update; it ran successfully, but I'm still getting the issue. Was it checking out the past commit that got it working for you?

I checked out both revisions which are mentioned in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/238 (some where in the middle of the issues comments) and did after that a `arc patch` and then `arc diff` (but for me the revision was created beforehand). For you an `arc diff` should be sufficient.

Thanks, all working now (I think!)

moved to phabricator, so closing this.
