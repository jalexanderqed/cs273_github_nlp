Various SCA fixes from cppcheck incl.:
- pass const parameter by reference
- use empty() over size() 
- perform init in initialization list
- prefer prefix ++operator for non-primitive types
- remove check for >=0 for unsigned variables
- reduce scope of variables
- remove unused variables
- correct format specifier
- suppress some cppcheck warnings

This is great, thanks @dalgaaf ! I'm merging after you fix the style (see previous comment)

fixed style

@dalgaaf there are some more places in the code where you attach & to the name instead of the type. Would you mind fixing those, too?

fix style also in other places as requested
