In https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/5ec53f3edf62bec1b690ce12fb21a6c52203f3c8 the Java code was not adjusted which lead to a non working Java build. This commit resolves the build problem.

Referring issue is: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/328

Thanks for spotting and fixing the error!
