Hi,
I have general question but dont know wher to ask this:
How is RocksDB compared with Redis?

I have not run any benchmarks comparing the two. If you do run any benchmarks, can you pl share it with us?

I simply asking about functionality and their support and reliability from a developer perspective.

I have not run benchmarks on redis, so I cannot comment on its reliability. But RocksDB is highly reliable and is guaranteed to not have any "silent data loss".

@dhruba Thanks a lot.
