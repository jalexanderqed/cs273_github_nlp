- Adjusted HashLinkedList to 3.6.0
- Adjusted SkipList to 3.6.0
- Introduced a memtable test

Test:
`make rocksdbjava`
`make jtest`

@yhchiang i didnt port cukoo cause igorcanadi meant this kind of memtable is still experimental. As long as this feature is experimental and other mandatory features are not in i would like to skip porting it.

@yhchiang shall i create a differential ?

@fyrz: yes, you can skip cuckoo.

@yhchiang anything new here ?

Nice catch-up.  Thanks for the contribution!
