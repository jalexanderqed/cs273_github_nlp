Hi,

I am consistently able to reproduce SIGSEGV when filter object is finalized by JAVA. Code to reproduce this issue: [1]. Interesting part is if options = null statement in this code is removed then segmentation fault doesn't happen.

Can someone please look into this issue? Thanks!

Looks like the reference dependency issue.  I remember @fyrz has addressed this with a diff.  Are you using the latest java build?

On master, given the source in the gist, the problem cannot be reprocuded on my machine. As yhchiang mentioned there was a change lately (see: https://github.com/fyrz/rocksdb/commit/bafbc23baa6a1bd2aac6575d66a89379278b815a).

Would be good to know which version you are using.

Thanks a lot @fyrz and @yhchiang. I was using 3.6.1 build and problem went away when I moved to the latest code.

@fyrz: Looks like your commit resolved the issue. Thanks again for your contribution :)
