RocksDB supports two ways of saving snapshots. In
memory and on disk. The later one was not available
in Java.

Hold on it. We are discussing to move this functionality to utilities path.

@siying will patch my pull request, when the decision is made. Can you comment in here about the outcome ?

@siying btw can you add to the discussion that the storage folder behavior is different from any other open directory method(see test).

@fyrz  what behavior difference do you mean?
CC @rven1 

@siying any other method doesn't care about existence of the passed folder. The CreateCheckpoint method fails if the directory exists.

If there's no c++ API change, then just the rocksjni.cc part should change accordingly.  However, if it's going to change c++ API, then I would suggest to put this diff on hold until the c++ snapshot is ready again.

@rven1 is the latest implementation now generally accepted ?

Yes, you can add the java support for it. Thanks @fyrz
