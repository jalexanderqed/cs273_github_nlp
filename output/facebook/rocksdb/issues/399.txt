Someone should also publish a 3.7.0 version in the 3.7.0 release branch.

Can we somehow get this info from `include/rocksdb/version.h`? We would like to have a single source of truth if possible.

@igorcanadi have a solution here will update later this day.

@igorcanadi i tested this version on centos 6.5 and works here fine

whos currently publishing the mvn artifacts ? anyone of the fb guys ?

Not sure, I think it's linkedin guys?

Thanks, this looks good, I'm merging this.
