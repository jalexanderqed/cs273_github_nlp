Thanks for makes this project.

I'm tried to compile rocksdb on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but I got an error message.

```
g++ -g -Wall -Werror -I. -I./include -DOS_LINUX -fno-builtin-memcmp -DLEVELDB_PLATFORM_POSIX -DGFLAGS -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -momit-leaf-frame-pointer -std=gnu++0x -Woverloaded-virtual -c db/db_test.cc -o db/db_test.o 
In file included from db/db_test.cc:27:0:

       truncate(logfilePath.c_str(), wal_files.front()->SizeFileBytes() / 2)     
                                                                           ^
./util/testharness.h:111:78: note: in definition of macro ‘ASSERT_EQ’
 #define ASSERT_EQ(a,b) ::rocksdb::test::Tester(__FILE__, __LINE__).IsEq((a),(b))
                                                                              ^
make: *** [db/db_test.o] Error 1
```

so add below code.

```
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
```

Am I wrong?

What version of g++ are you using? Can you try upgrading to 4.7 or 4.8?

I'm using 4.8.1. 

```

Have you finised compile without above header? 

I'm getting these erros:
db/db_bench.cc:14:27: fatal error: gflags/gflags.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.

on ubuntu 13.04 gcc 4.7.3

Do you need to install gflags? Is that a dependency we need to document?

On a recent ubuntu 12.10 install I had to do:
sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev

---

And I also had to add this to db/db_test.cc for the default (debug?) build
to define "truncate".

Yes, need to add "include <unistd.h>" to fix he compile failure

I am trying to add a storage engine to Voldemort based on rocksdb. Also running into trouble compiling snappy on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. Seems like the makefile has some hardcoded paths..

```
$:~/projects/rocksdb/snappy/snappy-1.0.5$ make
CDPATH="${ZSH_VERSION+.}:" && cd . && /bin/sh /home/dhruba/local/externals/java/leveldb/source/snappy-1.0.5/missing --run aclocal-1.11 -I m4
/bin/sh: 0: Can't open /home/dhruba/local/externals/java/leveldb/source/snappy-1.0.5/missing
make: *** [aclocal.m4] Error 12
$:~/projects/rocksdb/snappy/snappy-1.0.5$ grep -Ri "dhruba" Makefile | wc -l
11
```

It would be great if you guys can put together a guide on building.. 

Working on it ;)

Can you please try compiling on Ubuntu now? I am able to compile and run on Ubuntu 12.04.

A complete list of dependencies (required and optional) would be a good start.
The docs has been pretty good so far except for install/build docs :-)

I successfully compiled after installing libgflags-dev (thanks @mdcallag).

Works now.. Thanks guys! 

For others: On a fresh 12.04 LTS, the process is as roughly follows

```
1. sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev
2. Upgrade gcc/g++ to 4.8
See http://askubuntu.com/questions/312620/how-do-i-install-gcc-4-8-1-on-ubuntu-13-04
(it is for 13.04. but the process is common I think)
3. sudo apt-get install build-essentials devscripts
4. Install gflags
(its not 1-command if you are < 12.10)
see http://askubuntu.com/questions/312173/installing-gflags-12-04?rq=1


```

then make, make install in rocksdb and done. 

I don't think gcc 4.8 is required. I compile with 4.7.2 using Ubuntu 12.10

@igorcanadi @vinothchandar  :+1:  with only install build-essentials and upgrade gcc/g++, install gflags

Thank you

Added INSTALL.md: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md

I hope this is resolved. Let us know if you are still having issues.

:+1: 
@igorcanadi  you're awesome!

+1  or should I say "like" :P .. Thanks for adding the installation instructions guys.. 

A nice tut:
http://bienuit.wordpress.com/2013/12/04/how-to-install-rocksdb-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts/

In case of me, this one doesn't work.

```
brew tap homebrew/dupes; brew install gcc47 --use-llvm
```

instead of it, the below line makes me working on it.

```
brew tap homebrew/version; brew install gcc47 --use-llvm
```
