@haochun g++ 4.9 is as far as i know not yet supported. I suppose you use 4.9 ?

@fyrz  my g++ version is 4.8.2.do you know how to solve this problem?

@haochun i noticed the same problem once in travis-ci when compiling another make target beforehand. Did you try `make clean jclean` beforehand ?

@fyrz it works ,thanks you very much

@haochun can you close this one :-) ?

@fyrz i forget,i am sorry
