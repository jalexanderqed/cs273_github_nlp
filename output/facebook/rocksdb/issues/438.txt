wiki page says rocksdb support jemalloc , how to enable it?

Hmm, that's a good question. Check out how we do it for our internal build: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/build_tools/fbcode_config.sh#L38-L39. You should be able to do similar thing with our open source compile. If you figure it out, would you mind sending us a pull request?

Use of jemalloc might also require use of libunwind, which is a few lines
below in the same file. Also note that the --whole-archive option doesn't
just apply to the next library. It applies to all object files that follow.
There is a --no-whole-archive flag used much further in that file. I am not
sure if it should have been put immediately after the jemalloc or unwind
libraries.
