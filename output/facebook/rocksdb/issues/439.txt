It's still 22 commits. :/ Can you try making this only one commit? Maybe try something like:
`git diff master > ~/a; git checkout master; git checkout -b pull_request; git apply ~/a; git commit -a -m "Pull Request"`

I am assuming I should run this command from the "3.9.b" branch and change the "-b pull_request" to "-b 3.9.fb"

Done.

Here it is.
