`make install` is a standard way to copy all the library files to the system. rocksdb should have `make install` as well.

That makes sense.

I'll assign this to myself for now. Once I have bandwidth I'll be glad to add this feature. But if some one else is interested, please feel free to send us the feature request.

please reopen if somebody thinks this is important...
