I hope nobody is actually using this since it's changing disk format. It is tagged experimental in the .h file, though, so shouldn't be a problem.

Yeap, I've thought about that. Maybe it's worth adding versions.

@StanislavGlebik You should have commit access now.

@igorcanadi Yeap, I have it. Thanks a lot!
