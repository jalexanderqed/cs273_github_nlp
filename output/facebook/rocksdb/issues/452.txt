For your review. Thanks.

Umm, seeing failed test on another try on Travis.

https://travis-ci.org/robertabcd/rocksdb/builds/46322324
db/db_test.cc:9738: Assertion failure Put(Key(count), RandomString(&rnd, 1024), wo).ok()

Not yet reproducible on my machine.
Not sure if the issue is related to this commit.

Probably unrelated.

Would you also mind producing some performance numbers to demonstrate improved performance?

I do like this patch, though, thanks :)

Hmm. The pull request may be misnamed. The performance gain should be backup engine loading performance.

Thanks for contributing!
