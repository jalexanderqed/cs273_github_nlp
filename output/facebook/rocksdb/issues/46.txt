I ran `make` and see that it created static library only for the librocks.

There are some systems (e.g. Linux Arch) that strongly prefer to use shared libraries. It would be great that the build system provide shared libs as well.

Assign to me for now. Pull request welcomed.

In order to create shared lib, you should run `make librocksdb.so`.

It is not at the default target, because facebook does not use shared libs. See #29 

Perhaps the instructions should be in INSTALL.md then.

when I run make librocksdb.so, I get "make: **\* No rule to make target `librocksdb.so'.  Stop."
and I can't continue

Try `make shared_lib`
