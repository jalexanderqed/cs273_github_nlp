@yhchiang can you look into this ?

I want to review it more carefully, can you create a diff review for this?

@yhchiang i added the differential to the pull request description and integrated your comments.

Sorry for the delay, I will review it sometime later today.

Hey @fryz.  I left a comment under the diff.  Once the issue has been fixed it's ready to go :)
