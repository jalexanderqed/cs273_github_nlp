Adding LOG parser and modify some logging parts to make it easier to parse.

Mainly parse below 5 types:
- CompactionEvent
- FlushEvent
- StatisticsEvent(from DB Stats)
- OptionsEvent(Once, at the begging of LOG)
- Delete Event

I wonder where I should put parse_db_log.\* , so I temporarily put these files in utilities/parse_db_log.

Nice job! Can you move parse_db_log.\* to tools/ directory? Also, can you run `make format` on the commit?

@igorcanadi Thank you! I updated and run `make format`

Hm. Are you sure you ran `make format`? I still see rows of 80+ characters and missing empty spaces after `if`...
