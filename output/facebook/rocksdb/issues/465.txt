- Added  support for format version in BlockBasedTableFormatConfig

This depends on: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/464

As the dependency was merged i rebased onto master.

@yhchiang comments adressed. I removed also the reference to the format changes file as igor said its obsolete.

Looks good to me.  Thanks for adding this support!
