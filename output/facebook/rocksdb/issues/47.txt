[rocksdb/universal_compaction.h](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/31295b0a1bd8b2551e46b47e11e19a33236e1824/include/rocksdb/universal_compaction.h#L25) describes an alternate strategy for picking files to merge in a universal compaction, kCompactionStopStyleSimilarSize, but there's no apparent implementation. The strategy (if I understood it correctly) is precisely what I needed for a specific application, so I implemented it. Probably this will need some further adjustments going forward, but it's doing the trick for me.

I rebased this in light of c699c84af4

Can somebody pl review this? Looks like an useful implementation to me.

I have small comments, but code mostly looks good. Would like somebody else to take a look at it, though.

Thanks for the comments so far, agree & will do next week.

Hey @mlin , are you interested in finishing this or should we take over?

Sorry for delayed reply- 5e3aeb5f8e addressed the specific comments and I have no further immediate plans. All yours!

Tnx! :)
