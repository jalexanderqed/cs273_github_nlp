If support difference process?

I am not able to understand your question. Can you pl elaborate on your question?

A android application can include many process, only define on `AndroidManifest.xml` `android:process=":heloo"`, i want to know if the rocksdb support multi process. 
like https://github.com/nhachicha/SnappyDB/issues/36

No, sorry, RocksDB doesn't support access from two different processes.
