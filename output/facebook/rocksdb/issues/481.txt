Added simple wrappings allowing backing up RocksDB in C.
I don't have a lot of experience in C++, so comments are welcome.

Any updates?

Thanks for contributing! Can you also please add a unit test for the new feature? Also, please run `make format` to fix the styling.

- Added unit tests
- Added some more wrappers
- Made an ENV configurable

I have tried `make format`, but it make a code look nothing like a code around. Are you sure it works as it should?

Looks great! Don't worry about `make format`, I'll just run it on your commit once we merge it.

Just couple of nits:
- Can we also add restore procedure to c_test? Since we're backing up, we might as well show how to restore :)
- Can you please add comment on c_simple_example? I know code is mostly self-explanatory, but I think it would help some people.

Tnx!

I have already added restoration check/procedure to c_test. Have you missed it? Or maybe you are talking about adding it to c_simple_example?

Yeah, I was thinking about adding it to c_simple_example. The test looks good!

Done.

Great stuff!

Thank you.
