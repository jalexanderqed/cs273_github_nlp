the whole sst file must be loaded when doing sst merge, some useless value will be read into memory repeatedly, a lot of useless values can cost much memory,is it right?

Can you elaborate this problem a little bit more? What are the "useless values"?

Right now when compacting sst files, we'll not load the whole file; instead, we'll read 1 block (by default it is 4k) to the memory.

Is there an option to use madvise for those reads?
