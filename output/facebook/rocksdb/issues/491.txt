I noticed something odd. If I manually compact the db twice, then the size of the compacted SST is about 20% lower. (In one test 2.2G vs. 2.7G.) More oddly, the output of ls -sh and ls -lh don't agree, with the latter showing 2.2G in both cases.

Is this to be expected?

Can't think of any reason. Is it possible for you to paste the information logs for both runs here?

Unfortunately. I don't really have capacity to reproduce the problem chase down the LOG files. It looks like the block size and data size are different. Maybe the single-pass compaction is overestimating required space and reserving it somehow, which is resolved in the second? It's not a big issue, but this thread might help in the future if someone else has more serious issues with this.
