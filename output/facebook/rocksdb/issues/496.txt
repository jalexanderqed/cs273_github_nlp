My compilation of rocksdb is failing with following errrors:

/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/librocksdb.a(format.o): In function `BZip2_Uncompress':
/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/./port/port_posix.h:374: undefined reference to`BZ2_bzDecompressInit'
/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/./port/port_posix.h:393: undefined reference to `BZ2_bzDecompress'
/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/./port/port_posix.h:412: undefined reference to`BZ2_bzDecompressEnd'
/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/./port/port_posix.h:418: undefined reference to `BZ2_bzDecompressEnd'
/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/librocksdb.a(block_based_table_builder.o): In function`BZip2_Compress':

/home/storagevisor/rocksdb/./port/port_posix.h:362: undefined reference to`BZ2_bzCompressEnd'

I tried adding -lrt -lz in my LIBS. It used to work but started failing again. I believe I had just recompiled the static rocksdb library when I started seeing these failures again.

Those are for libbz2 (bzip2). This might install it -- 'sudo apt-cache
install bzip2'

This is weird. We don't compile BZ2 support if we detect you don't have BZ2 installed. See here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/build_tools/build_detect_platform#L256

Can you post your build output?

My build output is the one given earlier. I added the specific library name
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbz2.a after the rockdb library in my makefile
to make it work for the time being.

I mean full build output.

Some times people need to run "make clean" before building to clean up some of the issues.

Thank you for reporting this issue and appreciate your patience. We've  notified the core team for an update on this issue. We're looking for a response within the next 30 days or the issue may be closed.
