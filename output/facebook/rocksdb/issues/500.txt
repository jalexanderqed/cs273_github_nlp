Is there any PPA, or any way to install rocksdb without building from source?

Others can confirm but as far as I know, we don't have it for now.

Sorry @Raduh , only way to install rocksdb currently is from source. :(

It looks like there's a [rocksdb package](https://ftp-master.debian.org/new/rocksdb_3.13.1-1.html) languishing in Debian NEW. Once it passes, it'd be pretty easy to port this over to Ubuntu for a PPA.

That's awesome news!  :+1:
