Rocksdb,

Unpacking 3.9.1 and then "make static_lib" prints just
Makefile:34: **\* unterminated call to function `shell': missing`)'.  Stop.

Same thing with 3.8 and probably others. I have bash 4.3.11 on a Linux Mint 14
system.

What version of GNU make are you using?
If you change that line to begin with a dummy assignment, e.g.,

d := $(shell...

I think it will get you past that with any version of GNU make.

It is  GNU Make 3.80. Yes it did work, thanks. I myself am a Makefile-dummy and others like me exist, so I think it ought to be fixed.

I pushed the fix.

This is fixed.
