I am on a clean Linux Mint 17.1 which is derived from Ubuntu 14.04, and using the following process works for me:

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install git g++ automake openjdk-7-jdk curl
$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64
$ git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git
$ cd rocksdb
$ sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
$ make rocksdbjava
```

Perhaps that gives you a clue or tells you about something different that you are doing?

Hello;

make rocksdbjava runs successfully with Ubuntu 14.04 
and it produces the files /java/target/rocksdbjni-3.10.0-linux64.jar
and /java/target/librocksdbjni-linux64.so .

(However with Ubuntu 12.04 there are issues ...)

Thank you for your help,
Regards.

@osmanscam Do you need Ubuntu 12.04 support?

@adamretter I do not need support for 12.04. I have decided to go ahead with 14.04. after your comment above. now it seems working, i will continue working with this version.

about 12.04, even tough all related libraries were installed, make rocksdbjava was not working.

@osmanscam Okay well I don't have a Ubuntu 12.04 machine to test on and as it is not a priority for you anymore I will close this, and if someone complains again in future then we can look again...
