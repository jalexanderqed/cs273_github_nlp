I git cloned RocksDB and tried building it using 'make all' command. I am seeing these errors. Am I missing something?

I see these errors:

In file included from ./db/dbformat.h:18:0,
                 from db/builder.cc:13:
./util/coding.h: In function ‘uint32_t rocksdb::DecodeFixed32(const char_)’:
./util/coding.h:70:7: error: ‘port’ has not been declared
   if (port::kLittleEndian) {
       ^

 }

See #50 

@sepeth: Thanks.. Fix mentioned in #48 seems to be working. Will close this.
