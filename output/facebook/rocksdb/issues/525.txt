When running `make check` on Mac OS X (10.10.2), the tests fail with a segfault on master where HEAD is revision [694988b62793343c54d5620f7207c8d94e7d7f6e](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/694988b62793343c54d5620f7207c8d94e7d7f6e). e.g.:

``` bash
$ make clean check
```

Eventual output:

```

looking

For some reason, this throws a segmentation fault on Mac OS: https://gist.github.com/igorcanadi/f30e025050bc585462fd

It looks like this is the bug
http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=15337

It advise using the basic_ostream(basic_streambuf<char_type,traits>\* sb)
I tried to compile this code 
https://gist.github.com/IslamAbdelRahman/3383c108707a79b7e171

and it did not produce any segfaults

I had the same conclusion posted in Igor's gist note as well :). Will send out a patch soon.

Thanks guys. @igorcanadi any further thoughts on getting a Mac CI? I also mentioned it to @dhruba when I saw him on Weds.

@adamretter Dhruba started internal discussion about this. Stay tuned.

@adamretter is that one fixed ?

@fyrz Ah yes it is now, thanks. @igorcanadi Any updated on a Mac CI?

No updates yet. It will probably be a couple of months before we have something to share there.
