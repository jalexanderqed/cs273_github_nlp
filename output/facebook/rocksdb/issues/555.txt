@pshareghi adding dependencies to the Makefile shall not require additional steps to be performed. So it would be good if the lz4 support would be included as other compression libraries. See e.g. snappy.

@fyrz that is exactly what I have done here. The installation instructions above simply describe [as a courtesy to the user] how one can install LZ4 systemwide similar to what is described in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md). Ideally LZ4 should be mentioned as a dependency in INSTALL.md

Sorry missed that one. Maybe @yhchiang shall have a look at this one.

@fyrz No, your comment is quite clear and correct. You can see I have done the exact same thing you suggested in my commit. See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/555/files#diff-b67911656ef5d18c4ae36cb6741b7965R711

Thanks for adding this support, @pshareghi.  The patch looks good to me :)
