When building Rocksdb on Centos 6, we noticed that the ROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT flag is never present, although our kernel support fallocate and the FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE flag.

The reason for test failure is that FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE is defined in `linux/falloc.h` which is missing from the test in build_detect_platform script

```
#include <fcntl.h>
int main() {
  int fd = open("/dev/null", 0);
  fallocate(fd, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE | FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 0, 1024);
}
```

I will add a separate pull request to merge our fix.

Nice find!

The bug is fixed in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/584
