The WriteBatchWithIndex when operating on the default column family does not correctly use the comparator specified in Options when the DB is created/opened. It will always use ByteWiseComparator unless a comparator is explicitly specified in the construction of the WriteBatchWithIndex.

Is this a bug or an issue with documentation? I thought it's the expected behavior. WriteBatchWithIndex doesn't have access to default column family's comparator. @siying will know more.

Ah ok, if this is expected behaviour then that is fine, but perhaps we could make it clearer in the comments in the code and on the wiki

@adamretter WriteBatchWithIndex doesn't figure out default comparator by itself because it doesn't have a pointer to DB so it doesn't know. You can tell us by not using functions like:

  void Put(ColumnFamilyHandle\* column_family, const Slice& key,
           const Slice& value) override;

Just pass a default column family handle. While if you use interface like this:

  void Put(const Slice& key, const Slice& value) override;

Then you'll be responsible to pass in a default comparator. I'll update the comments to make it clear.

Thank you for reporting this issue and appreciate your patience. We've  notified the core team for an update on this issue. We're looking for a response within the next 30 days or the issue may be closed.
