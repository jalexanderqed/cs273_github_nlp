The ASSERT_GT fails

   1886         // no block cache, only compressed cache
   1887         ASSERT_EQ(options.statistics.get()->getTickerCount(BLOCK_CACHE_MISS),
   1888                   0);

   1890                   (BLOCK_CACHE_COMPRESSED_MISS), 0);
   1891         break;

Do you have bz2 and snappy libs installed?

RocksDB includes snappy and libs were built during make. However, I don't see how snappy or zlib or bz2 were linked. They aren't mentioned in make output and bzip2 is installed for sure. I think the makefile needs help. Will start a separate issue for that.

I just pulled in everything in build_tools/build_detect_platform (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/build_tools/build_detect_platform#L186) and the tests now run fine for me.

The point of having build_tools/build_detect_platform is for things to run
fine when everything isn't there. That isn't the case right now.

Does this test need checks to avoid compression tests when -DSNAPPY and other compression options were not compiled? "make check" passes when snappy, bzip2 and zlib have been installed.

I think we should just require all three libraries (snappy, bzip2 and zlib) to be installed. They are all standard libraries and can be easily installed on all linux platforms.

Added requirements on all three compression libraries in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md

It would be good for `build_detect_platform` to work even if only a subset of them is installed, but they are so easy to install it doesn't make much sense to worry about it.
