All  the  read  and write opertion are blocked ã€‚ the  process seems deadlock.

There is  the  thread  stack info
#0  0x0000003864a0b5bc in pthread_cond_wait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 () from /lib64/libpthread.so.0

Is this the only thread? Can you send the stacks of other threads? Can you send us your LOG file?

threads  have the some stacks .  The WARN LOG is 
"[default] Stopping writes because we have 4 immutable memtables (waiting for flush), max_write_buffer_number is set to 4"

the rocksdb options about flush  and  compaction are 
Options.max_background_compactions: 8
Options.max_background_flushes: 8

why does rocksdb stop flush immutable memtables  to sst ?
how can i slove the problem.

This has been solved in 3.11 release (https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/b0fdda4ff07f2cc52b1f1ed77cfac47e02a86b96 is the commit). Can you please try verifying if this has been solved for you?
