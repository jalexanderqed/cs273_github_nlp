Is there a way to load the compressed tables into memory without using a tmpfs or ramfs?

@ekg did you have a look at `MemEnv` ?

Is there a test case showing how to use it to open a db from disk? I
haven't found one and my attempts at getting it to work have failed.

@ekg it's a hacky way and i think it was also not the devs intention. But a possible way would be to use the `BackupableDB` to backup to a `MemEnv` which incorporates a virtual directory layout. After backing things up you can use the memory environment. Theoretically this should work, but i didnt test it.

@ekg you can use `vmtcouch` command to preload your table into OS cache. You can even make them pinned in memory.

@igorcanadi Thanks, vmtouch seems to do the trick. However, as non-root I'm not sure I can use `mlock` to make large files sticky.
