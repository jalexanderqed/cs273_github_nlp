error: format specifies type 'unsigned long' but the argument has type 'SequenceNumber'
      (aka 'unsigned long long') [-Werror,-Wformat]

Tnx @stege ! Looks like travis build failed because PRIu64 was not recognized. I think you can fix that by adding 

```
#ifndef __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
#endif
```

before you include inttypes.h

I stole your PR and merged it in https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/4c181f08bca568efc42a9d90c612a7569bf9c388 :)

ok thx
