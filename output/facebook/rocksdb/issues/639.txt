This PR adds JNI calls to set/get the max_table_files_size option for FIFO compaction.

The java API call is setMaxTableFilesSizeFIFO on Options and ColumnFamilyOptions. It does not directly expose the FIFO options struct since there is only one option to set.

This PR should not be merged until tests are working again. Currently they dont. (Which is not related to this PR)

@fyrz OK, yes I saw some unit tests seems to fail. I tried to take a look at it too, but couldn't find what was wrong (I noticed that some of them passes sometimes).

The naming convention is OK?

Thanks!

@cleaton for some i got fixes for one remaining problem i need to find a solution these days. Probably today so it shouldn`t be much of a problem. Just wanted to inform about the delay. 

@fyrz any updates?

@cleaton we did some fixes last week. So i`ll check this this evening. Sorry for the delay.
