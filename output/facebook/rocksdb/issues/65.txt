It seems that there is a missing include with g++-4.7:

```
$ make CXX=g++-4.7
g++-4.7 -g -Wall -Werror -I. -I./include -std=gnu++11  -DROCKSDB_PLATFORM_POSIX  -DOS_LINUX -fno-builtin-memcmp -DROCKSDB_FALLOCATE_PRESENT -DGFLAGS -DZLIB -DBZIP2   -DHAVE_JEMALLOC -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -momit-leaf-frame-pointer -Woverloaded-virtual -c db/compaction.cc -o db/compaction.o 
In file included from ./db/compaction.h:11:0,

```

Fixed with the following patch:

```
diff --git a/db/version_set.h b/db/version_set.h

Tnx for the report! Fixed with https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/e57f0cc1a1c19537f221c74b0171880edb3d48e3
