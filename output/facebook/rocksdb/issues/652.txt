  Introduce include/rocksdb/public_port.h with minimum porting required for Windows
  Add a new file util/db_test_util.cc to CMake file. Would be nice for now to enforce this in code review until
  CI is in effect and we find a better solution.

Synced with @igorcanadi . You can guard with Win32 or _MSVC, or whatever not showing up in other platform. Only include those needed in public header. That means remove the port for ROCKSDB_PRIszt, snprintf and strcasecmp

@siying Are you in favor of that single header OR individual #ifdefs as required?

@yuslepukhin Don't have a strong opinion on it. If you guard it with _MSVC or so, perhaps it's a better idea to guard only once, instead of everywhere.

I am not able to understand the need for a public header file called public_port.h. This file defines things like "define ROCKSDB_PRIszt "Iu"". Can's it be a non-public header file?

@dhruba I agree define like ROCKSDB_PRIszt should not be there. But there are two things that are hard to solve. "**thread" is used in perf_context.h. We probably want to change it to a function but we probably need to do it later. Also "__attribute**(deprecated)" is used in 5 different places and is not supported in Windows. Don't know how to support it. The easiest way to work around to define it as none in Windows.

This things are already ported/defined within port/win/port_win.h and it is useful to include to a non-public headers and .cc files.

However, we cannot include the above into public headers for two reasons 1) that would require port to be among public include paths 2) would require #define that are in our make files to be in the clients makefiles.

The solution proposed is to have a minimum porting public header that would have some of the above in it and depend on the #defines that are automatically set by a compiler.

Thanks,
Dmitri

Hi siying, the __attribute() in the public header files are protected by ifdef GNUC and windows does not define GNUC. So I am wondering how this is a problem.

@dhruba can you point me the ifdef GNUC guard? I can't find it.

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/env.h#L717

@dhruba that one is fine. The problem is this: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/include/rocksdb/db.h#L434 and four other attribute deprecated.

I see. maybe we can protect all these via ifdef **GNUC**?

@dhruba good idea. Something worth trying.

@dhruba @siying Providing this is all I will try to re-work this.

pseudo-code

```
#if defined(__GNUC__) // and clang, etc?
#define ROCKSDB_DEPRECATED __attribute__((deprecated))
#elif defined(_MSVC)
#define ROCKSDB_DEPRECATED __declspec(deprecated)
#else
#define ROCKSDB_DEPRECATED
#endif
```

@msb-at-yahoo thanks Maurice but that would be a separate header and it looks like for public headers ones they want inline.
