A general compaction filter that will remove key/value pairs during compaction that have empty-values. Also added support to the Java API for using this.

Also addresses the issue raised here - https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/562.

@adamretter can you add a differential ?

@fyrz Sure! The differential is here - https://reviews.facebook.net/D42255

Hi, I'm wondering if this feature has already been released in RocksDB? Currently I cannot find it in Java's ColumnFamilyOptions for setting compaction filter.

 It was merged on Aug 4 so it should have been released long ago. Which release version did you check?

I'm using 3.10.1.

You can set it by name. I'm on holiday right now so I can remember quite
how the code looks, but I am using it.
