- Remove make file defines from public headers and use _WIN32 because it is compiler defined
- use **GNUC** and **clang** to guard non-portable attributes
- add #include "port/port.h" to some new .cc files.
- minor changes in CMakeLists to reflect recent changes

Sorry for loosing the comments in the previous PR. Git would not co-operate.

Great! Please rebase the codes and I think it will be ready to go.

Maybe as a separate diff but incluce/rocksdb/c.h has yet another OS_WIN to remove.

@siying I think this might be the right place to do it.

@yuslepukhin should replace it by _WIN32?

@siying Yes, that is the way to do currently.

Merged. Thank you for your contribution and patient in addressing the comments.
