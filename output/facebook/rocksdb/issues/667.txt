- std::chrono does not provide enough granularity for microsecs and periodically emits
  duplicates
- the bug is manifested in log rotation logic where we get duplicate
  log file names and loose previous log content
- msvc does not imlement COW on std::strings adjusted the test to use
  refs in the loops as auto does not retain ref info
- adjust auto_log rotation test with Windows specific command to remove
  a folder. The test previously worked because we have unix utils installed
  in house but this may not be the case for everyone.

The PR is good to merge to me, but I don't understand why it caused a bug in your second point.

@siying  NowMacros() is used to create new file names during file rotation.
