Hi,
I am running Debian x64 inside a openVZ container with Proxmox 3.x

When i try to build with "make", it fails:
db/compaction_picker.cc: In member function 'virtual rocksdb::Compaction\* rocksdb::UniversalCompactionPicker::PickCompaction(rocksdb::Version_)':
db/compaction_picker.cc:556:41: error: format '%lu' expects argument of type 'long unsigned int', but argument 3 has type 'std::vector<rocksdb::FileMetaData_>::size_type {aka unsigned int}' [-Werror=format]
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors
make: **\* [db/compaction_picker.o] Error 1

If I disable "all warnings being treated as errors" in the makefile, it fails when I build the shared library:

db/db_bench.cc:1529:76: warning: format '%ld' expects argument of type 'long int', but argument 3 has type 'size_t {aka unsigned int}' [-Wformat]

util/options.cc:248:36: warning: format '%ld' expects argument of type 'long int', but argument 3 has type 'size_t {aka unsigned int}' [-Wformat]
..

Any hints?

Another hint:
db/memtable.cc:155:3: error: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Werror=sign-compare]

My fault - installed a 32 bit version by mistake

Does it not build on 32-bit systems? Maybe we claim it doesn't but it might be nice to support that.

It worked without a problem with Debian x64 - the 32 bit version had problems

Tnx for the report. I fixed some of your issues here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/5c6ef56152f8dc0fe9631332c5e8aa8b20bfbd5e

Can you please post the entire compile error log?

Sure - log is with werror removed from Makefile
