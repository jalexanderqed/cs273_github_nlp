I've packaged RocksDB v3.11.2 for Debian/Sid. It seems to be working, but the self test fails with the following.
[ RUN      ] ColumnFamilyTest.SanitizeOptions
[       OK ] ColumnFamilyTest.SanitizeOptions (0 ms)
[ RUN      ] ColumnFamilyTest.ReadDroppedColumnFamily

My system is an amd64 but I can give you more information if requested.

That's interesting. Seems like we weren't able to read the data from the dropped column family. 

I tried running this test 100 times on my system (centos something) and it didn't fail. Does it fail deterministically in your case?

Can you please try the test on master? 

Yes, it's failed all the time. Some days ago I've tried it again with the latest stable (3.13.1) release. It doesn't fail. This issue can be closed.

Cool. Let us know if you see some other test failures!
