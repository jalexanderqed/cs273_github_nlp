Current fixed length prefix extractor restricts in usage of keys smaller that the prefix length. 

Thanks for adding this support.  Have merged and fixed the test failure caused by missing the native implementation of Java_org_rocksdb_ColumnFamilyOptions_useCappedPrefixExtractor.  

Somehow git does not pick up my fix.  Am submitting a diff for the fix.

Tests passed for me when I ran it locally and even travis showed the test as passed. Anyways thanks for merging the PR :) .

The diff has been merged.  Closing the request.
