Hi,

What is the timeline of publishing rocksdb-jni 3.13.0 to maven? I see there is a java release today.

@anagav I can try and take a look at this perhaps by the end of the week.

Yes!

Please consider including building and publishing rocksjni to maven as part of the normal release process.

Thanks.

I am closing this as RocksJava has been published to Maven Central as part of the official release for some time now.
