Commit 257ee89 added a static destruction helper to avoid notional
"leaks" of TLS on main thread exit. This helper fails to compile on
OS X (and presumably Windows, though I haven't checked), which lacks
the __thread storage class StaticMeta::tls_ member.

This patch fixes the builds. Do note that the static cleanup mechanism
may be somewhat brittle and atexit(3) may be a more suitable approach
to releasing the main thread's TLS if it's highly desirable for this
memory to not be reported "reachable" by Valgrind at exit.

I've signed the CLA.
