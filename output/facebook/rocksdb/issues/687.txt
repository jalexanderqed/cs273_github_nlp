Any ideas?

It looks like an issue with make running the prerequisites for `all` in parallel. Which version of make are you using? What was command that you used?

Can you try "make clean" and retry? If you try to make release build, and then build tests, you will likely to fail with this error.

Hey @Andymic, I'm closing this issue since it's inactive. Let us know if you're still seeing issues.

@4tXJ7f I am using make 4.0
@siying Tried it initially and 'make clean' didn't work

@igorcanadi  Ok, have not tried since then but I will grab latest and try again. Thanks

Did you do a `make clean all` or something similar? This can lead to
problems, `make clean && make all` on the other hand should work.
