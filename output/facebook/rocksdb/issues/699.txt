Summary:
This patch adds the helper functions and variables to allow a backend
implementing WritableFile to support direct IO when persisting a
memtable.

Test Plan:
Since there is no upstream implementation of WritableFile supporting
direct IO, the new behavior is disabled.

Tests should be provided by the backend implementing WritableFile.
