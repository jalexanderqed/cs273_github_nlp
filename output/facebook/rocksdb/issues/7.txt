This check from build_tools/build_platform_detect won't define LEVELDB_CSTDATOMIC_PRESENT because <cstdatomic> doesn't exist for gcc 4.7. Maybe it did for older gcc versions, but I don't track modern gcc/g++ enough to understand it. I think the check might need to use "include <atomic>" instead.

```
# If -std=c++0x works, use <cstdatomic>.  Otherwise use port_posix.h.
$CXX $CFLAGS -std=c++0x -x c++ - -o /dev/null 2>/dev/null  <<EOF
  #include <cstdatomic>
  int main() {}
```

EOF
    if [ "$?" = 0 ]; then
        COMMON_FLAGS="$COMMON_FLAGS -DLEVELDB_PLATFORM_POSIX -DLEVELDB_CSTDATOMIC_PRESENT"
        PLATFORM_CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x"
    else
        COMMON_FLAGS="$COMMON_FLAGS -DLEVELDB_PLATFORM_POSIX"
    fi

Tnx Mark, addressing this.

Done, we're using <atomic> now.
