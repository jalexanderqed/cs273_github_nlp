  Previous change for the function
  https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/555ca3e7b7f06bd01dfd5e04dbb2cef5360f7917#diff-bdc04e0404c2db4fd3ac5118a63eaa4a
  made use of the QueryPerformanceCounter to return microseconds values that do not repeat
  as std::chrono::system_clock returned values that made auto_roll_logger_test fail.

 The interface documentation does not state that we need to return
 system time describing the return value as a number of microsecs since some
 moment in time. However, because on Linux it is implemented using gettimeofday
 various pieces of code (such as GenericRateLimiter) took advantage of that
 and make use of NowMicros() as a system timestamp. Thus the previous change
 broke rate_limiter_test on Windows.

 In addition, the interface name NowMicros() suggests that it is actually
 a timestamp so people use it as such.

 This change makes use of the new system call on Windows that returns
 system time with required precision. This change preserves the fix
 for  auto_roll_logger_test and fixes rate_limiter_test.

 Note that DBTest.RateLimitingTest still fails due to a separately reported issue.

Thank you for fixing it.
