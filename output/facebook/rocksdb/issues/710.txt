OptimizeLevelStyleCompaction unconditionally defaulted to kSnappyCompression,
which is a problem if it's not supported. Checks for and uses it, LZ4, or no
compression if neither are around.

Tnx for your contribution. Did you sign CLA?

I haven't signed the CLA yet. I'll get back to you on that - need to make sure I can sign it (or have it signed on my behalf).

Let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

We do run tests through phabricator, a tool we use for code review. We call them linters and you can try it out with `arc lint`. You might need to install arcanist first: https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/

For code formatting, we also have a tool `make format`. Try it out :)
