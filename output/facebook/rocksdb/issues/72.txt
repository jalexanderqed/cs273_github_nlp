<b>port/port_posix.h, line 339</b>
A constant Z_BUF_ERROR is used, which seems to be undefined if zlib was not found while bzip2 was (since it is defined in zlib headers).

It seems that just deleting this line would be a nice workaround, since it is a case followed by the default case.

Yes, deleting that line is a good solution. Tnx for reporting!

I'll fix this later today. Or feel free to submit a pull request :)

Ok, I'll submit a pull request
