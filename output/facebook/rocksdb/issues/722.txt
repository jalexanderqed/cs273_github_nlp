Wiki page https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations#cache contains the following example, which cannot be compiled with current RocksDB (a5e312a7a475c6607845ccca3330d73bb88f7740):

``` cpp
  rocksdb::Options options;
  options.block_cache = rocksdb::NewLRUCache(100 * 1048576); // 100MB uncompressed cache 
  options.block_cache_compressed = rocksdb::NewLRUCache(100 * 1048576); // 100MB compressed cache

  // ...

  delete options.block_cache; 
  delete options.block_cache_compressed;
```

This example won't work anymore, because `rocksdb::Options` doesn't have a member `block_cache`. 
The option in question seems to have been moved into struct `BlockBasedTableOptions`.
The example should be updated accordingly.

Tnx for reporting this. I updated the wiki: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Basic-Operations

thanks!
