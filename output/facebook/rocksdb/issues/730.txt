@siying What do we do with java failures?

@yuslepukhin it is known that Java build is failing and @yhchiang is working on it. I think the patch is good to go.

The change should have nothing to do with Java build.

@siying It is not a problem with macro max rather with the fact that numeric_limits are not constexpr with the compiler being used.

@yuslepukhin  it looks good. I'll merge after Travis tests pass.
