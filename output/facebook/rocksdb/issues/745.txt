Yes, we should find a way to trigger apveyor builds on Phabricator. As a reference, this is how we currently trigger builds in our internal Jenkins:
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/arcanist_util/unit_engine/FacebookFbcodeUnitTestEngine.php
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/arcanist_util/config/FacebookArcanistConfiguration.php#L32

Something similar can also work with Apveyor.
