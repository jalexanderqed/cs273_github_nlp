When call > cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64" .. < on the downloaded zip project an error occures on this line:

string(REGEX REPLACE "[^0-9a-f]+" "" GIT_SHA ${GIT_SHA})

The former call of git fails and the variable GIT_SHA is not set.

Got the same error (CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:35 (string):
string sub-command REGEX, mode REPLACE needs at least 6 arguments total to
command.)  on CMake 3.0.0

my fix: change line 34 of CMakeLists.txt on

```
execute_process(COMMAND $ENV{COMSPEC} " /C git -C ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} rev-parse HEAD" OUTPUT_VARIABLE GIT_SHA)
```

@Vaisman Pull request?

@yuslepukhin pull request #770

@DoktorSeltsam close issue?

With the call of `cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 Win64"  ..` (using cmake 3.3.2.) i still get an error:

...
-- LZ4 library is disabled
-- ZLIB library is disabled
-- JEMALLOC library is disabled
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:35 (string):
  string sub-command REGEX, mode REPLACE needs at least 6 arguments total to
  command.

pull request #778
check is git installed and check is .git folder exists in project

It seems to be all right now. Thanks for your effort. So it's time to close the issure...
