I put RocksDB through a Coverity Scan. Looks pretty good.

block_based_table_builder.cc line 112:
filter_block(opt.filter_policy == nullptr ? nullptr : new FilterBlockBuilder(opt))
There is no destructor that deletes this new FilterBlockBuilder.

db_stats_logger.cc line 42:
Should probably lock the mutex before changing bg_logstats_scheduled_.

BZip2_Compress in port/port_posix.h has a stray line:
return output;

 NewRandomRWFile can technically leak the file descriptor fd if it takes the if (options.use_mmap_writes || options.use_mmap_reads) path.

Most of the false positives are related to the use of std::unique_ptr and some shortcuts in test code.

Tnx! I'll fix this tomorrow :)

filter_block - false positive, deletion in line 113
db_stats_logger - MaybeScheduleLogDBDeployStats() is always called with mutex held.

I'm fixing the rest
