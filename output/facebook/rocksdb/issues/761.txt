Hi I'm facing an error which is: Compression type Snappy is not linked with the binary.

I got this error while running the `simple_example` in the `examples/` directory. I simply built this by using `make simple_example`. However, this program failed at the `s.ok()` assertion. So I followed the instruction in the wiki to find out what had happened. With `s.ToString()`, I've got the error message listed previously.

It seems that I haven't got this library, so I've built it again with this option:

```
options.compression = kNoCompression;
```

But still, that error message showed up again..

Thanks for your help!

Can you please install snappy library before compiling RocksDB? This should be pretty simple. For example, if you're running Ubuntu, you just have to call: `sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev`

Hi @igorcanadi Your idea works, thanks a lot. :+1: 

I make a rocksdb shared library for golang use, I want to use `LZ4` compression. But it said `Invalid argument: Compression type LZ4 is not linked with the binary.`

I execute `make liblz4.a`, It still show this message.

lz4  lz4-devel needed by   rocksdb  . But the document do not mention it
