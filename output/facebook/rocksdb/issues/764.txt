Fixed the java crossbuild jar packaging.  Prior to this change the following error would occur as a result of running <code>make jclean clean rocksdbjavastaticrelease</code> after a clean clone/checkout.  

```
cd java;jar -uf target/rocksdbjni-4.1.0.jar librocksdbjni-*.so librocksdbjni-*.jnilib
librocksdbjni-*.jnilib : no such file or directory
make: *** [rocksdbjavastaticrelease] Error 1
```

This is addressed by forcing all java artifacts (jars and libraries) to write out to the java/target directory, and then the packaging of the final jar is done within that directory.  This has the added benefit of <code>make jclean</code> actually working to clean up all of the java output files.

Thanks for fixing this.
