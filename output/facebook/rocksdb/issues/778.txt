- add validation is git found
- add validation is .git folder exists in project (project zip archive download without .git folder)
- get head commit SHA if git found and .git folder exists

Tested:
- configure project by CMake 3.0.0 successfully (with and without git), with project zip archive (without .git folder) and with project cloned from github
- configure project by command: cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64"
- build solution by Visual Studio
- manually validate that file utils/build_version.cc contains valid head revision value

@Vaisman The build is slow. How does your change take to build on your dev box?

@yuslepukhin 
Build on dev box
- my local system:
  - 07 min 41.08 sec - with my fix
  - 07 min 41.10 sec - without my fix
- CI system with my fix:
  - 22 min 24 sec - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vaisman/rocksdb/build/1.0.1

@Vaisman I will check how I can merge with my newly acquired rights

Can somebody rebuild in AppVeyor ?

@Vaisman this is supposed to be rebuilt automatically

@yuslepukhin I will merge if you are OK with the commit.

@siying Pls, merge.
