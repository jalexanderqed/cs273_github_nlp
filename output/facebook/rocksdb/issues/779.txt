  Test code errors are currently blocking Windows Release build
  We do not want spend time building in Release what we can not run
  We want to eliminate a source of most frequent errors when people
  check-in test only code which can not be built in Release.
  This feature will work only if you invoke msbuild against rocksdb.sln
  Invoking it against ALL_BUILD target will attempt to build everything.

@igorcanadi Pls, merge this if there is no objections.

I'm blindly accept changes to MakeLists.txt. I hope your teammates reviewed it.

I remember we gave you two commit permission. If it's a change only touch Windows codes, please feel free to review it and merge by yourselves.
