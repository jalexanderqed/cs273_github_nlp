   Remove conditional compilation as we no longer build tests in Release
   Previously windows build attempted to build tests in Release
   which led and continues to lead to failures. We no longer
   build test only code in Release builds so #ifdefs are no longer
   necessary.

Yay for less ifdefs!

BTW it looks like this PR also contains other unrelated code. Can you please submit a PR that only removes the conditionals?
