I'm fine with the code part of the change. However, by removing the parameter names, we will make it harder for users to understand what those parameters are. For example,

```
-  virtual bool KeyMayExist(const ReadOptions& options,
-                           ColumnFamilyHandle* column_family, const Slice& key,
-                           std::string* value, bool* value_found = nullptr) {
+  virtual bool KeyMayExist(const ReadOptions&,
+                           ColumnFamilyHandle*, const Slice&,
+                           std::string*, bool* value_found = nullptr) {
```

Users don't know the third parameter is key and the forth is value. So you may need to do something like:

```
 virtual bool KeyMayExist(const ReadOptions&,
                         ColumnFamilyHandle*, const Slice& /* key */,
                         std::string* /* value */, bool* value_found = nullptr) {
```

if you want to get the commit in.

By the way, where did you get the warnings?

@siying agreed - in my project I include rocksdb/db.h and build with -Werror -Wunused-parameter, which fails with the current code; the rocksdb makefile also has -Wno-unused-parameter (which IMO should not be the case)
