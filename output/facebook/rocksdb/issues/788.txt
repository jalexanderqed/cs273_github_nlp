Summary: This patch moves all posix thread logic to separate library.
The motivation is to allow another environments to easily reuse posix
threads. HDFS wraps already posix threads; this split would simplify
this code.

Test Plan: No new functionality is added to posix Env or the threading
library, thus the current tests should suffice.

@siying @igorcanadi Does this make sense to you? Thanks!

Sorry I forgot the patch. The general approach is good to me. Can you move those implementation of functions from .h file to .cc files?

No problem, thanks for looking into it :) The logic is moved to thread_posix.cc now.
Let me know if I should make any further changes.

@siying Rebased and pushed again with the changes you proposed. Let me know if something else should be changed. Thanks.

Thanks @siying!
