After checking out master I attempted to run `make all` but run into a compilation issue.

```
In file included from util/io_posix.cc:12:
./include/posix/io_posix.h:172:35: error: use of undeclared identifier 'errno'
      return IOError("directory", errno);
```

My gcc version is:

```
iMac:rocksdb abramsm$ gcc --version
gcc (Homebrew gcc49 4.9.3) 4.9.3

Adding `#include <errno.h>` to include/posix/io_posix.h resolves the issue for me.  It has been a very long time since I've worked with gcc so this could be something stupid on my part.

I'm fixing it: https://reviews.facebook.net/D49551

I committed it. Can you sync and retry?

That fixed it.  thanks for the quick turn around.
