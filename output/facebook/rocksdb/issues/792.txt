In the current implementation, for building blockbase table, every data_block is flushed when it's full. 
For buffered io, this is fine, since os will take care of the write caching and actual IO. 
For unbuffered io, this is not be the ideal behavior, since small unbuffered write is expensive and undesirable. For example, block size of 4k would result in a lot of 8k disk write (write need to aligned). 
To solve this problem, we can use the aligned buffer in WritableFileWriter to aggregate more data before we do the actual disk I/O. A simple logic would be wait until the buffer is full before we issue a disk write.

During the implementation of this, I found server issues: 
1) FlushBlockPolicy actually determines the condition when the data_block is full. A better name for it would be SealBlockPolicy
2) BlockBasedTableBuilder::Flush() writes the data_block to WritableFileWriter's buffer and issue the Flush to WritableFileWriter. These two steps should be decouple to two independent functions.

To fix 2), I suggest 
- Refactor BlockBasedTableBuilder::Flush() into two functions: SealBlock(), FlushBlock()

To fix 1) and implement the write-behind algorithm described above, there are two options:
a) Extend FlushBlockPolicy such that it return two conditions: should_seal_block, should_flush_block
or
b) Introduce an function MaybeFlush() to WritableFileWriter, which will determine whether to flush the buffer according to the use_os_buffer setting and it's own status

Any suggestions? 

@siying, @yuslepukhin and I had a discussion offline. 
We are considering removing Flush() as a whole in the table builder, since we already have a buffer at WritableFileWriter layer. If the WritableFileWriter can perfectly manage buffers in Append(), there wouldn't be any benefit of calling Flush() everytime. 
However, we are not sure if WritableFileWriter is well tuned enough for no flush call at all and we will need to verify this.

Any thoughts/concerns on removing the Flush() in tablebuilder ? 

I think it would be safe for us to provide an option to skip Flush in block based table builder, and still leave the default behavior to be the same as today.

OK. I guess this is the safe way to go. 

No explicit Flush() is called in PlainTableBuilder. All the flush is managed in WritableFileWriter.

Merged. Closing now.
