See https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/793 
- Added GetPlainTableOptionsFromMap() for string option parser
- Added corresponding test for GetPlainTableOptionsFromMap()

Hi @siying , could you please review and merge this? 
PlainTableOption support has been long missing in option helper, and we are now in need of this to experiment PlainTable. 
Thank you. 

Taking a look.

It looks great to me, except the code style comments I posted, but I would wait for @yhchiang to take a look before merging as he recently worked on this file extensively.

Thanks @siying  for reviewing this. 
I will make another checkin to fix 
1) naming convention from GetTableOptions() to table_options()
2) const string for common strings

Forgot @yhchiang is on PTO. Let me merge it, and please send the the follow-up change just after that.

@yhchiang please feel free to take a look after you come back.

Thank you :)

Can you take a look? I may revert the diff if it can't be fixed after a few moments.

https://reviews.facebook.net/D49767 should fix it.
