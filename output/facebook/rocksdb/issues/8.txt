This code doesn't compile when bzip2 is installed but zlib is not. Regardless is it not correct to use Z_BUF_ERROR here.

see http://www.bzip.org/1.0.3/html/low-level.html

  int old_sz =0, new_sz =0;
  while(_stream.next_in != nullptr && _stream.avail_in != 0) {
    int st = BZ2_bzCompress(&_stream, BZ_FINISH);
    switch (st) {
      case BZ_STREAM_END:
        break;
      case BZ_FINISH_OK:
        // No output space. Increase the output space by 20%.
        // (Should we fail the compression since it expands the size?)
        old_sz = output->size();
        new_sz = (int)(output->size() \* 1.2);
        output->resize(new_sz);
        // Set more output.
        _stream.next_out = (char _)&(_output)[old_sz];
        _stream.avail_out = new_sz - old_sz;
        break;
      case Z_BUF_ERROR:
      default:
        BZ2_bzCompressEnd(&_stream);
        return false;
    }
  }

And BZip2_Uncompress uses Z_OK and Z_BUF_ERROR which also come from zlib. Those references should be changed to BZ_\* equivalents.

Tnx Mark, I fixed the problem.
