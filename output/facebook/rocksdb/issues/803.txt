@sying, as we have discussed, I have added a new option skip_table_builder_flush
In addition, I make the buffer size configurable through option. This allows user to tune for optimal disk I/O size for flush.

Hi @siying, really appreciate it if you can take a look at this... 

@SherlockNoMad Siying is currently on vacation, he will be back next week.

@igorcanadi, I will take a look

LGTM, will merge after fixing the minor comment

Thank you @IslamAbdelRahman, I have fixed the white space at the end of line.
