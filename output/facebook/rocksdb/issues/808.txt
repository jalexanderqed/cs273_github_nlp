Currently, Statistics class only expose a limited number of counters. In the internal_stat.cc file, there are some interesting counters which can be very useful for the user, such as counters in InternalCFStatsType, InternalDBStatsType. In addtion, the compaction Statistics and block_cache memory usage could also be expose throught the same interface.

Proposal:
1) Extend existing StatisticsImpl class to expose the column family's counter, and etc. I can add the counters to TickerInternal enum type (which is empty now). 
or
2) Have a new class that implements Statistics interface, and include the cloumn family's counters.
