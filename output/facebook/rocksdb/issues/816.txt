Hi @satnam6502, appveyor CI build start to failed after this change: 
https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Facebook/rocksdb/build/1.0.75 
I believe it's related to the "Add RocksDb/GeoDb Iterator interface" commit. 
This commit fix the problem. 
Could you please merge this commit? Thanks. 

Thanks @SherlockNoMad
