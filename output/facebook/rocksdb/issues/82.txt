This pull request adds enhancements to the API which I need for my Go wrapper: https://github.com/tecbot/gorocksdb

Please review careful the part with the merge operator because I am not a C expert so maybe I did something wrong.

I completed the CLA.

LGTM

I will probably switch my Go code to use gorocksdb instead of my gorocks package as soon as this is merged.

Can you please add basic merge operator sanity tests to db/c_test.c (few puts, few gets, nothing major)? Can you also explain reason behind removing `free(filter)` at line 125?

Otherwise looks good, thanks a lot!

Hi Igor,
- I fixed the size_t and the four space indent.
- I removed `free(filter)` because you didn't know whether the client has allocated the memory in the C space. The client should take care of it this is also the problem why the valgrind test is failing but I didn't know how I can fix it or do you think we should force the client to allocate the return value in the C space?

For the test I have currently no time. I could do it maybe on Friday.

Somehow if the function returns a pointer the unwritten rule is that the caller is responsible for cleaning the memory. Can we make sure that client allocates the memory in the C space?

Alternative solution could be to add a Delete method that would be default call free(filter), and client can implement its own solution for freeing the memory if he wishes.

I decided to implement your alternative solution also I added a test case for the merge operator.

Tnx!

Merge operator test seg faulted. Here's the fix: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2bf1151a25de5c711d0c863973c2d995e1137c60

Oh no, I didn't see the small message at the end of the test. Sry for that :/
and the rename is of course correct, argh...
