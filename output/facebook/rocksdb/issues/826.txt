can i use one rocksdb instance in multithreads?

void\* read(void\* arg)
{
db=arg;
db->Get();
}

void\* write(void\* arg)
{
db=arg;
db->Put();
}

int main() {
pthread_create(tid, read..)
pthread_create(tid, write..)
pthread_join();
}

if use like this, rocksdb will core dump~~~

Does anybody want to use like this?
or i have to create multi rocksdb instances?

Yes, you can.  Get and Put() are thread-safe.  Some other structures (like a WriteBatch instance) cannot be shared between thread unless you handle the concurrent access yourself.

Are you getting a core dump?  If so, can you paste the stack trace?

tks~~~got it~~
