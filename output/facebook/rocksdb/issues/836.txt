i learned disable_seek_compaction from wiki，but it is deprecated now，i want to know how can i turn this feature on ? or if max_open_files is large, default value is true?

content in wiki:
Options::disable_seek_compaction - Disable compaction triggered by seek

The "seek compaction" feature is deprecated for impacting performance of reads. So there is no such feature now.
