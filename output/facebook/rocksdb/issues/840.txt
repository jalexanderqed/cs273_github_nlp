Currently the C-API does not allow a caller to pass custom CompactRangeOptions. The signature of rocksdb_compact_range is 

``` c
extern ROCKSDB_LIBRARY_API void rocksdb_compact_range(rocksdb_t* db,
                                                      const char* start_key,
                                                      size_t start_key_len,
                                                      const char* limit_key,
                                                      size_t limit_key_len);

extern ROCKSDB_LIBRARY_API void rocksdb_compact_range_cf(
    rocksdb_t* db, rocksdb_column_family_handle_t* column_family,
    const char* start_key, size_t start_key_len, const char* limit_key,
    size_t limit_key_len);
```

I'm guessing the C api was forgotten about when introducing these new options.  Would you be interested in submitting a patch to fix this?

@agiardullo I can do that. Would it be okay to break the current C-API as a part of this fix?

How about you just create a new function so it wont break the api?

@agiardullo Alright. Will do this.
