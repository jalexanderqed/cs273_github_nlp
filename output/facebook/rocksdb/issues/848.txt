In benchmarks that mix multiple types of operations, such as readrandomwriterandom and seekrandomwhilemerging, we wish to have separate histogram measurements for latency.

This change split the histogram to per OperationType: 
 std::unordered_map<OperationType, HistogramImpl> hist_

Can you measure the performance costs of the change?

Hi @siying 
I have run the db_bench readrandomwriterandom test for perf check with other conditions remained the same.
No perf regression is observed.

@SherlockNoMad cool. I'll merge it after we unfreeze the branch.

Can you please merge all the commits into one?

@igorcanadi 
As requested, merged to one commit. 
Thank you for reviewing this.
