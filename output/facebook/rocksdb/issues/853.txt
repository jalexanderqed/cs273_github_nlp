- run tests

@Vaisman Thanks for helping out. I will look at it. I have these changes in my private branch as well unpublished because of another PR pending which is not currently reviewed.
@siying @igorcanadi Do you have any objections to this and  https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/pull/846 requests. I realize these might be too many changes but these two appear to be important for the correct functionality on Windows.

@Vaisman Please, run both db_test and individual tests. Recommend setting gflags /i <image> +vrf

@yuslepukhin Thanks for your comments,  I''l fix it.

Can somebody review?

@Vaisman @siying This looks good to me as far as I can see.
