I am having a maven project where I am using rockdb java dependency like:
     <dependency>
          <groupId>org.rocksdb</groupId>
          <artifactId>rocksdbjni</artifactId>
          <version>3.5.1</version>
      </dependency>
When I am running it in intellij, it is running fine but when I am trying to run it from the command line using mvn command, it is throwing the following exception:
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: librocksdbjni-osx.jnilib was not found inside JAR.
    at org.rocksdb.NativeLibraryLoader.loadLibraryFromJar(NativeLibraryLoader.java:34)
    at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.loadLibrary(RocksDB.java:50)
    at org.rocksdb.RocksDB.<clinit>(RocksDB.java:28)
    ... 27 more
mvn command used: mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.application.Application"
Can someone please tell me what am I missing?

thanks

@chnaik The latest version of RocksDB should include support for Mac OS X inside its Jar file.
