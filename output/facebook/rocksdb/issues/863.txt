- include `util/string_util.h` which contains `ToString` macro in `env_hdfs.cc` to fix ToString not declared error
- implement `LinkFile` function by returning a NotSupported status to avoid LinkFile undefined reference error, because HdfsEnv class defines LinkFile function without implementing it and actually, HDFS does not provide such API in c.

Thanks @zhangyybuaa, What build error are you trying to fix ?

@IslamAbdelRahman, I followed the instructions in `hdfs/README` and set up environment variables. And I changed `DEBUG_LEVEL` to 0 in Makefile. Then I run `make db_bench` and got the flollowing errors:

```

I fixed this by 4687ced. And then I got another error:

```
util/env_hdfs.o:(.rodata._ZTVN7rocksdb7HdfsEnvE[_ZTVN7rocksdb7HdfsEnvE]+0x90)： undefined reference to ‘rocksdb::HdfsEnv::LinkFile(std::string const&, std::string const&)’
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

```

I fixed it by be006d2. Then build succeeded.

Hey @zhangyybuaa , is your fix merged?  I see the same error as yours

@IslamAbdelRahman we are trying to compile rocksDB + hdfs flag but got the same issue. Is it a known issue? Is this fix planned to be merged?

I wouldn't recommend using our hdfs_env without careful review. We use a different one internally, so we don't run this one in production. It is only meant to be an example.

@igorcanadi hmm, that's interesting. I read through this doc https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/How-to-backup-RocksDB%3F and it showed the possibility to use HDFS as the backup environment. So is compiling with USE_HDFS=1 the correct way to enable HDFS backup? Or there is another correct way to do so? 

Another question: Although compiled with hdfs_env, the header file is not copied to /usr/local/include, also the dependeicies like port/sys_time.h is also not copied to sys dir. Is it a bug? Should I manually do a copy? 

@shuzhang1989 I agree that this HDFS dependency thing is a mess. We should have defined a factory class under include/rocksdb/

Are you willing to contribute to the code base? Just add a
    Env\* NewHdfsEnv();
Or
    Status NewHdfsEnv(Env**);
declaration in files like env.h, and implement it in env_hdfs.cc. Make sure if USE_HDFS is not set, return an error message.

@siying yeah with pleasure, let me see what i can help. 
Because it is a blocker on our project, if I merge it this month, will it be included in next release?

@shuzhang1989 I met the same problem before. I have a quick fix in my fork and it works for me.
FYI 07fe3720a6fbb2de68216c73324b9c0126b8d45f . I hope it can help you.
I just prefer treating db name as a URI to get the corresponding ENV pointer but it might damage to code base.
It will be great if you add NewHdfsEnv() method and get it merged.

@siying I have this pending PR , mind taking a look?
