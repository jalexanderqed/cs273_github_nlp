@siying @igorcanadi This test failure is not related to this PR since the changes are test only

@siying @igorcanadi btw, that test also fails on Windows

@yuslepukhin we know the build is not stable now. We are currently freezing the branch and actively working on fixing it.

@siying this is actually fixing a test so we should merge it
