cmakelist.txt runs "git" to detect git related information. That only works for cloned source tree. For download of a official release package, that does not work.
Be specific, the following line will cause error:

string(REGEX REPLACE "[^0-9a-f]+" "" GIT_SHA ${GIT_SHA})

This is because GIT_SHA is empty. And the variable is not quoted.

Another error is this line:

COMMAND echo "const char\* rocksdb_build_git_datetime = \"rocksdb_build_git_datetime:${GIT_DATE_TIME}\";" >> ${BUILD_VERSION_CC}

In my environment, this cause error below:

 The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

It seems to be caused by the colon in time string.

@allspace Would you like to propose a patch?

@yuslepukhin I created fix for date time here. Are you OK with that? Can I create pull request? Basically the problem is that date and time utilities are producing different result on different platforms. I used powershell. I know it is not optimal, but it works...
