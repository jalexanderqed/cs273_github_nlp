The Windows porting uses certain API which is only available on Windows 8 or later.

GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime is one of such APIs.

I am not sure if there are other such APIs too...

Can we eliminate using of such kind of APIs so the rockdb.dll can be used on Windows 7 too?

seems no other API block Windows 7 support.

As long as replace GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime to GetSystemTimeAsFileTime, test app can work on Windows 7 well. 

But I am not sure if such replace is valid. I did not get time to check the context of the usage.

@allspace See discussion here https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/726

@allspace You can propose a patch that would have an `#ifdef` for a Windows 7 build driven by a CMake switch.That would mean a deliberate choice with known trade offs.
