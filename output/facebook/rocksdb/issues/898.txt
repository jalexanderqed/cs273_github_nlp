```
db/db_test.cc:4780:10: error: moving a local object in a return statement prevents copy elision
      [-Werror,-Wpessimizing-move]
  return std::move(file_numbers);
         ^
db/db_test.cc:4780:10: note: remove std::move call here
  return std::move(file_numbers);
         ^~~~~~~~~~            ~
```

`-Wpessimizing-move` was introduced in clang 3.7.

Thanks for your contribution!

@zhipeng-jia  You should  never use std::move on return. Believe it or not it may suppress the move. C++11 compiler will apply it automatically if applicable.

@yuslepukhin  I agree. We still have several places with it. We can't even upgrade to the latest CLANG because it reports those warnings. In our next TechDebt week from Jan 19-25, we will try to make RocksDB build using the latest CLANG, which may require us to address all those move returns.
