Pasting my sample code below:
# include "rocksdb/db.h"
# include "rocksdb/utilities/backupable_db.h"
# include <iostream>

using namespace rocksdb;     

int main() {

Options options;
options.create_if_missing = true;
DB\* db;
DB::Open(options, "/tmp/rocksdb", &db);
db->Put(WriteOptions(), "key1", "value");
BackupEngine\* backup_engine;
Status s = BackupEngine::Open(Env::Default(), BackupableDBOptions("/tmp/rocksdb_backup",nullptr,false,nullptr,false,true,true,0,0) , &backup_engine);
std::cout << s.ToString() << std::endl;
backup_engine->CreateNewBackup(db);
delete db;
delete backup_engine;
}

I specify the value for "share_table_files" as "false", and "destroy_old_data" as "true" - i do not want incremental backups and all the older backups should be deleted. However this gives the following error(when I run the above code):

IO error: /tmp/rocksdb_backup/shared/: No such file or directory
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I suspect we are checking for the "/shared/" folder by default in GarbageCollect() - {which is being called by Initialize}, even when we can provide an option where the shared folder does not get created. The line is :

Thanks for the great error report, this was likely caused by https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/8a9fca2619d0bbfeb3918fafae5a60bd7aa75033. I'm investigating and will submit the fix.
