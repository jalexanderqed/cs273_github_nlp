I tried to build master branch of rocksdb on Windows 7.
I found that "tools/ldb_cmd.cc" denpends on "tools/sst_dump_tool_imp.h", 
and "tools/sst_dump_tool_imp.h" depends on "util/testharness.h", 
and "util/testharness.h" depends on 'gtest/gtest.h'.

I just tried to build a release version.
I think it should not denpend on 'gtest/gtest.h'.
I just comment out #include "util/testharness.h" in "tools/sst_dump_tool_imp.h", and found the compilation is OK.
Am I do it right?

@siying I don't think it is a WIndows problem. For some reason tools that are rightly build in release include test related headers.

@yuslepukhin ahh, sorry I misunderstood that. If that is the case, we should fix it.

Looks good to me. Perhaps, after this is checked in, I can address another issue by @strrchr 

@yuslepukhin I checked it in.
