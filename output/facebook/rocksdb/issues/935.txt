I tried to build master branch of rocksdb on Windows 7.
I think these files should not be included in release build:

```
table/mock_table.cc
util/mock_env.cc
util/testharness.cc
util/testutil.cc
```

@strrchr testharness.cc and testutil.cc are currently required by the code. I tried to move them to a test only library but failed.
