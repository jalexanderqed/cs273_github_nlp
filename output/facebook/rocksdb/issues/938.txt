Thanks for your contribution @alexander-fenster! Looks like the build throws a warning, check out https://travis-ci.org/facebook/rocksdb/builds/101656838

My bad. Let me fix it

Thank you for signing our Contributor License Agreement. We can now accept your code for this (and any) Facebook open source project. Thanks!

So this would make it possible to do `ldb --db=DB scan --no_value | wc -l` to get the number of entries, correct?

This would certainly be an improvement over my current approach:

```
ldb --db=DB scan | grep -e '^[0-9a-f]\{40\} : ' | wc -l
```

Yup @bolinfest. We just need to wait for @alexander-fenster  to fix the compile warning.

Sorry, totally forgot about it. Just fixed all the warnings.
@bolinfest: you should also use --hex, otherwise, if your keys or values contain '\n', it may not count lines properly.
