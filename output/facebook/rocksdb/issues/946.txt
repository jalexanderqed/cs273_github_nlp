Hi.

I'm trying to migrate our system from LevelDB to RocksDB.

The development environment is VS2015 and the current RocksDB code is from commit 1477dcb.

Whenever I try to read old data, I get an assertion from this line:

[assert(smallest_seqno <= largest_seqno);](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/1477dcb37d0b60c8e242e35847ee32bcfe84f6f4/db/version_edit.h#L188)

Call Stack:

```

```

The constructor of `FileMetaData` initializes those members with initial data in order to be replaced later by actual data; but it seems that it doesn't happen when reading old log files.
However, the code still arrives to a function which asserts they are exists and set correctly.

Am I missing anything?

Thanks for your report. This is a legit problem. LevelDB's MANIFEST does not include smallest_seqno and largest_seqno in its file entry. kNewFile is LevelDB's file entry (we have later introduced kNewFile2, kNewFile3 and kNewFile4 formats):
https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/1477dcb37d0b60c8e242e35847ee32bcfe84f6f4/db/version_edit.cc#L367

With smallest_seqno and largest_seqno uninitialized they are set to 0 and maxseqno here: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/1477dcb37d0b60c8e242e35847ee32bcfe84f6f4/db/version_edit.h#L97

...which fails this assertion.

Can you try the build in optimize mode?

Thanks for the response.

@igorcanadi I got that from my little debug session. Yet, it seems like RocksDB should be backward-compatible with LevelDB so I was thinking it might probably be either a wrong placed assertion or wrong flow of control for a LevelDB database.

@siying I'll try this when I get to work tomorrow. I guess the assertion will be optimized out. But, if it works, and should work, why is the assertion there in the first place?

I built in optimize mode and at first glance it seems to work.
Nevertheless, it's not a real solution because we can't really debug our product.

We can remove the assertions from the code, but this is our last resort.

Suggestions will be appreciated.
