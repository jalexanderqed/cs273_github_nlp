Can you please resolve the conflicts?

@igorcanadi Seems to be a build failure [here](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/rocksdb/jobs/103160689) which does not seem to be related to the change done by me in USERS.md

@ankneo don't worry about the build failure. The problem is with merge conflicts because of https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/commit/2e9fae3f2a00e38dfef58f7778d5321d5bd07bfd
