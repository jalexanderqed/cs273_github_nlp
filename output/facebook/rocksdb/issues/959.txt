@yuslepukhin Here is fix for generated GenerateBuildVersion.vcxproj when one builds on different locale than english. The problem is that date and time CLI utilities generates different format so that REGEX in CMake does not work.

It also contains fix for util/auto_roll_logger.cc that was recently moved to different directory.

facebook/rocksdb#868

Providing @siying is happy with Travis failure this looks good.

Yes that was unrelated.

@koldat thank you for your contribution!
