@yuslepukhin I pushed code review fixes. Please review latest changes.

Looks like you need to rebase off master

@koldat @siying Lets wait for the checks to pass otherwise looks good. Thank you for your contribution.

@siying I rebased to latest, let's wait for tests.

@siying I changed RollLogFile to follow your suggestion.
