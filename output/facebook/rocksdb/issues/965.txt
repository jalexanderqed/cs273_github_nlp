Initial support for building JNI library for Windows. Also some modification in Java unit tests to make it pass.

@yuslepukhin I was modifying CMakeLists.txt to add support for Windows JNI build. Can you check if changes are OK?
#703

@yuslepukhin @adamretter I pushed changes that should address code review issues.

@koldat Looks good to me. @yhchiang are we still using Phabricator for merging changes?

@adamretter I changed a way of how to reference int_backup_ids. When vector is empty it cannot be dereferenced.

@koldat Okay cool, I can't really comment though as my C++ is not strong enough to know what the implications of that change are.

@yuslepukhin I changed JNI to subproject (like gtest) and rebased branch so it should pass the build.

@siying I changed int_backup_ids back to vector. The problem was dereferencing empty vector. I used data() method that was added in C++11, that should work even for empty vectors. I also squashed changesets to one, rebased to latest and fixed one test that was not passing with release DLLs.

For bigger change, yes it is suggested to use Phabricator as it's easier to review and discuss.

@adamretter @yuslepukhin is it good to merge?

@siying All good from me
