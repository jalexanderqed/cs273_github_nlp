I'm new to rocksdb and I compiled the examples and tried running the the c_simple_example from the example folder, but it fails with the following error 
`Assertion failed: (!err), function main, file c_simple_example.c, line 28.
Abort trap: 6` 
What might be going wrong ? How to fix it ?

Have you try printing out the error message you get (which is stored in `err`)?
