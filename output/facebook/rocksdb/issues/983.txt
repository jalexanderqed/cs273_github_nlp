While trying to using `ReadOptions::iterate_upper_bound` in combination with a DB that uses a custom comparator (i.e. `ColumnFamilyOptions::comparator`) I discovered https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/db/db_iter.cc#L278:

```
      if (iterate_upper_bound_ != nullptr &&
          ikey.user_key.compare(*iterate_upper_bound_) >= 0) {
        break;
      }
```

`DBIter::FindNextUserEntryInternal` is using `rocksdb::Slice::compare` to compare the user key against the iteration upper bound. That doesn't seem to mesh with the presence of a custom comparator. Is there a reason for this or is it just a bug?

Oh wow. Definitely a bug.

I can send a PR to fix. Sending a PR with a new test might take a bit longer. 

Don't worry about a test.

Thank you for discovering it!
